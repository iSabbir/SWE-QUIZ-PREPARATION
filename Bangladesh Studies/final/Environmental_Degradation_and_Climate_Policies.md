# Environmental Degradation and Climate Change Policies

---

## 1. Factors Responsible for Environmental Degradation (Types)

Environmental degradation occurs due to the combined effects of **social, economic, political/administrative, and environmental factors**.

### Social Factors
- **Population pressure** increases demand for natural resources, resulting in biodiversity loss, air pollution, and water pollution.
- **Poverty** acts as both a cause and consequence of environmental degradation. Poor communities often lack access to clean water, housing, healthcare, and sanitation, forcing unsustainable use of natural resources for survival.
- **Urbanization**, especially unplanned mega-cities and expanding slums, intensifies pollution, waste generation, and ecological stress.

### Economic Factors
- **Industrialization-based development** leads to excessive use of energy and natural resources, causing air, water, and land contamination.
- **Agricultural development** contributes to:
  - Soil erosion
  - Salinization
  - Nutrient depletion
  - Water pollution from pesticides and chemical fertilizers
- **Transport systems** increase environmental stress through air pollution, noise pollution, and oil spills.

### Political and Administrative Factors
- Weak leadership
- Poor enforcement of environmental laws
- Low public awareness
- Ineffective policy implementation  
These issues significantly worsen environmental degradation.

### Environmental Factors
- **Habitat fragmentation**
- **Pollution** of air, water, and soil  
These directly threaten ecosystems and biodiversity.

## 2. Major Environmental Problems in Bangladesh

Bangladesh faces multiple environmental challenges due to rapid population growth, urbanization, and climate vulnerability.

### Major Problems
- Water pollution
- Air pollution
- Noise pollution
- River pollution
- Biodiversity depletion
- Natural disasters
- Deforestation
- Soil erosion
- Landslides

### Water Pollution
- Caused by rapid **urbanization and industrialization**
- Discharge of untreated **industrial and urban waste effluents**
- Use of **agrochemicals**
- **Buriganga River** is the most polluted, followed by **Shitalakhya River**
- **Groundwater contamination** includes:
  - Arsenic pollution
  - Fecal contamination in tubewells due to poor construction and management

### Air Pollution
- Severe in large cities, especially **Dhaka**
- Major sources:
  - Vehicle emissions
  - Traditional brick kilns
  - Road dust
  - Construction activities
  - Biomass burning

### Noise Pollution
- Increasing due to:
  - Excessive vehicle horns
  - Traffic congestion
  - Construction work
  - Industrial activities
- **UNEP (2022)** identified Dhaka as the **noisiest city in the world**
- Noise levels exceed **WHO standards**
- Bangladesh has **Sound Pollution (Control) Rules, 2006**

### River Pollution
- Large volumes of industrial and municipal waste are dumped into rivers, especially those surrounding Dhaka.

## 3. National and International Initiatives for a Sustainable Environment

### International Initiatives

- **Stockholm Conference (1972)**  
  - A milestone in global environmental governance  
  - Expanded the concept of environment  
  - Led to the establishment of **UNEP** and strengthened **IUCN**

- **Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 1988)**  
  - Provides scientific research, assessments, and guidance on climate change

- **Kyoto Protocol**
  - Set legally binding greenhouse gas emission reduction targets for industrialized countries
  - Entered into force in **2005**

- **Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)**
  - Allows developed countries to earn emission credits by investing in mitigation projects in developing countries  
  - Example: **Dhaka waste-to-compost management project**

- **UN Climate Processes**
  - Cancun Agreements
  - Durban Platform
  - Doha Amendment  
  - **UNEP initiatives** such as the *Billion Tree Campaign*

- **Conference of the Parties (COP)**
  - Annual decision-making forum for major international environmental conventions

### National Initiatives (Bangladesh)

- **Constitution of Bangladesh (15th Amendment)**  
  - Article **18A** mandates protection of environment and biodiversity
- **Vision 2021**
  - Commitment to protect Bangladesh from climate change impacts
- **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**
  - Integration of environmental sustainability into national development planning

## 4. Mitigation and Adaptation Policies for Climate Change in Bangladesh

Bangladesh has adopted comprehensive strategies combining **funding mechanisms, policy frameworks, and on-ground resilience measures**.

### Funding Mechanisms
- **Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund (BCCTF)**
- **Bangladesh Climate Change Resilience Fund (BCCRF)**

### Policy Frameworks
- **National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA, 2005)**
- **Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP, 2009)**

### Implementation Measures
- Construction of **7,000 km coastal embankments**
- Establishment of **2,700 cyclone shelters**
- Advanced **early warning systems** for cyclones and floods
- Deployment of **42,000 coastal volunteers**
- Development of **coastal green belts** through afforestation
- Introduction of:
  - Salinity-tolerant rice varieties
  - Submergence-tolerant rice varieties
  - Short-duration crop varieties

### Objectives
These measures aim to:
- Reduce disaster risks
- Protect coastal and vulnerable zones
- Strengthen agricultural resilience
- Support livelihoods amid increasing:
  - Floods
  - Cyclones
  - Salinity intrusion
  - Sea-level rise
