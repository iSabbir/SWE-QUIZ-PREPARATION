# Economic Profile of Bangladesh

---

## 1. Nature of Bangladesh’s Economy (≤200 words)

Bangladesh has a **mixed economy** where both the government and the private sector play significant roles. The country mainly follows a **free-market economic system**, while **public–private partnerships (PPP)** are increasingly used to implement development activities. Over time, the private sector has expanded effectively and become a major driver of economic growth. Bangladesh also places strong emphasis on **foreign direct investment (FDI)** to accelerate industrialization and infrastructure development.

In terms of external earnings, the economy is heavily dependent on **export income from the Ready-Made Garments (RMG) sector**, which is the largest contributor to export revenue. Additionally, **foreign remittances** from overseas workers play a crucial role in supporting foreign exchange reserves and household incomes. Bangladesh also relies on **overseas labor markets**, national and international loans, and development assistance.

The economy maintains an **open-border relationship** with the global market and depends on cooperation with international organizations, development partners, and foreign countries to support sustainable economic growth.

## 2. Historical Background of Bangladesh Economy (≤200 words)

After independence in 1971, Bangladesh’s economic system evolved through different political phases. During the **Sheikh Mujibur Rahman era (1972–1975)**, the country adopted a **nationalization policy**, establishing a state-owned economic structure to rebuild the war-torn economy.

In the **Ziaur Rahman era (1976–1981)**, Bangladesh shifted toward a **denationalized economy**, encouraging private sector participation. This trend continued and strengthened during the **H. M. Ershad era (1982–1990)**, with greater emphasis on privatization and private investment.

During the **Khaleda Zia governments (1991–1996 and 2001–2006)**, increased importance was given to **trade liberalization** and expanding economic cooperation with countries such as India, China, and the United States.

In the **Sheikh Hasina eras (1996–2001 and 2008–present)**, the focus expanded to **foreign investment, international migration, remittance inflows, mega development projects**, and improving the overall investment climate and regional connectivity, including initiatives like **BIG-B**.

## 3. Linear and Circular Economy: Preference and Reason (≤200 words)

A **linear economy** follows a “**take–make–waste**” model where raw materials are extracted, products are manufactured and used, and then discarded as waste. This system depends heavily on virgin resources, encourages mass production and consumption, and generates large amounts of waste due to limited reuse or recycling.

In contrast, a **circular economy** is a regenerative system designed to benefit the economy, society, and the environment. Instead of disposing of products at the end of their life, it emphasizes **reuse, recycling, repair, and restoration**. The circular economy aims to **decouple economic growth from finite resource consumption**, reduce waste generation, and promote renewable energy and sustainable product design.

### Preferred Model
The **circular economy** is preferable because it provides long-term **environmental and economic benefits**. It reduces greenhouse gas emissions, conserves natural resources, minimizes waste, and creates new employment opportunities through recycling and innovation. For a resource-constrained and climate-vulnerable country like Bangladesh, the circular model supports sustainable and resilient development.

## 4. Key Barriers to Achieving Bangladesh’s SDG Goals (≤200 words)

Bangladesh faces several barriers to achieving the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**. Major governance-related challenges include **corruption, political instability, and weak bureaucratic structures**, which limit effective planning and implementation. Economic barriers such as **aid dependence**, **black money**, and **money laundering** also undermine sustainable development efforts.

Structural constraints further hinder progress, including **rapid population growth, land scarcity, and rising unemployment**. Human capital limitations—such as lack of knowledge, skills, and a shortage of skilled and competent manpower—reduce productivity and innovation capacity.

Coordination problems among institutions pose another challenge. **Improper coordination and unclear roles of government and development organizations** weaken policy effectiveness. Additionally, Bangladesh is highly vulnerable to **natural disasters** such as floods, cyclones, and river erosion, which repeatedly damage infrastructure, livelihoods, and development gains.

These combined political, economic, social, and environmental barriers make achieving SDG targets more complex and require strong governance, institutional reform, and long-term planning.
