# Liberation War of Bangladesh (1971)

## 1. Discrimination Between East and West Pakistan

After the creation of Pakistan in 1947, the country was geographically divided into **East Pakistan** and **West Pakistan**, separated by more than 1,600 kilometers. Despite East Pakistan having a **larger population**, it faced systematic discrimination in almost every sector.

### Political Discrimination
Political power was concentrated in West Pakistan. Even though East Pakistan held a demographic majority, it was consistently denied fair representation. Democratic mandates were ignored, and central authority remained dominated by West Pakistani elites, leading to the denial of political rights for Bengalis.

### Economic Discrimination
Most national resources, development budgets, industrial investments, and foreign aid were allocated to West Pakistan. East Pakistan, despite being the main source of export earnings (especially through jute), remained economically underdeveloped and exploited.

### Cultural and Linguistic Discrimination
The cultural identity of Bengalis was suppressed. One of the earliest and most significant forms of discrimination was the attempt to impose **Urdu as the only state language**, marginalizing the Bengali language spoken by the majority. This resulted in the historic **Language Movement of 1952**.

### Military and Administrative Discrimination
Bengalis were severely underrepresented in the military and civil administration. This imbalance allowed West Pakistan to maintain control through force rather than democratic governance.

### Consequences
These discriminations created deep resentment among the people of East Pakistan. The situation worsened when the Pakistan Army launched mass killings and genocide in 1971, treating the crisis as an internal issue instead of addressing legitimate demands. Continuous deprivation and oppression ultimately led the people of East Pakistan to fight for independence through the **Liberation War of 1971**.
