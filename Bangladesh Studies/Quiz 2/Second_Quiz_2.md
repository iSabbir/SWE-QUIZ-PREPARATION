# **1. Factors of Environmental Degradation (পরিবেশ অবক্ষয়ের কারণসমূহ)**

(Environmental degradation = Damage to the physical environment due to human & natural causes → **পরিবেশের ক্ষয় বা ধ্বংস**)

### **Major Factors (from slides) — with explanations**

### **1. Water Pollution (জল দূষণ)**

**Cause:**

* Industrial effluents (শিল্প বর্জ্য) dumped into rivers
* Wastewater from urban areas
* Agrochemicals (কীটনাশক)
* Arsenic contamination in groundwater

**Key example:**

* Buriganga = most polluted river
* 54% tubewells found with fecal contamination (মলদূষণ)

👉 **Keyword meaning:** Effluent = বর্জ্য পদার্থ

---

### **2. Air Pollution (বায়ু দূষণ)**

**Sources:**

* Vehicle emissions
* Brick kilns
* Road dust
* Construction works

**Impact:**
World Bank report: 15,000 premature deaths yearly.

👉 **Keyword:** Emission = নির্গমন

---

### **3. Sound Pollution (শব্দ দূষণ)**

**Sources:**

* Traffic horns
* Construction noise
* Industrial noise
* Trains, buses, trucks

Dhaka's noise level is far higher than safe limit → leading to hearing problems.

👉 **Keyword:** Noise = শব্দ, Pollution = দূষণ

---

### **4. River Pollution & Encroachment (নদী দূষণ ও দখল)**

* Uncontrolled industrial dumping
* Human waste
* Encroachment (দখল) reducing natural flow
* Example: Buriganga, Turag, Balu receive 2 million m³ waste per day.

---

### **5. Depletion of Biodiversity (জীববৈচিত্র্য হ্রাস)**

**Cause:**

* Monoculture plantations (একজাত ফসল)
* Deforestation
* Pollution
  12 wildlife species already extinct.

👉 **Keyword:** Biodiversity = জীববৈচিত্র্য

---

### **6. Soil Erosion (মাটি ক্ষয়)**

Especially in hill districts due to:

* Deforestation
* Shifting cultivation
* Unplanned development

Effects: loss of fertility, siltation, increased flood risk.

---

### **7. Natural Disasters (প্রাকৃতিক দুর্যোগ)**

Bangladesh is disaster-prone → flood, cyclone, drought, river erosion.
These events destroy environment & human habitats.

---

### **8. Deforestation (বন উজাড়)**

* Forest should be 25% of land, Bangladesh has only 16%.
* Annual deforestation rate: 3.3%
* Leads to global warming, desertification, biodiversity loss.
