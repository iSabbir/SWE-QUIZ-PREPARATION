### **1. Factors of Environmental Degradation (পরিবেশগত অবক্ষয়ের কারণসমূহ)**

**Simple & Detailed Answer:**

Think of the environment like a healthy person. Environmental degradation is what makes that person sick. The "sickness" in Bangladesh is caused by many reasons:

**a) Too Many People Moving to Cities (দ্রুত নগরায়ণ):**
*   **What happens?** Every year, millions of people leave their villages and move to cities like Dhaka and Chittagong to find jobs and a better life.
*   **How does it harm the environment?** To make space for all these people, we need to build houses, roads, and factories. This means we cut down trees, fill up ponds and canals (which causes waterlogging), and destroy farmland. All the waste from these millions of people pollutes the air and water.

**b) Pollution from Factories and Vehicles (শিল্প ও যানবাহনের দূষণ):**
*   **What happens?** Factories, especially garment and leather factories, release their chemical waste directly into rivers. At the same time, thousands of cars, buses, and trucks emit black smoke, and traditional brick kilns burn coal and release tons of dust and smoke.
*   **How does it harm the environment?** This factory waste poisons the river water, killing fish and making the water dangerous for bathing or drinking. The smoke from vehicles and brick kilns makes the air dirty, causing people to suffer from breathing problems and diseases.

**c) Cutting Down Trees (বন উজাড়):**
*   **What happens?** Trees are cut down for firewood, to build houses, and to create new farmland.
*   **How does it harm the environment?** Trees give us oxygen, clean the air, and their roots hold the soil together. Without trees, the soil becomes weak and gets washed away by rain (this is called soil erosion). Also, birds and animals lose their homes, and many species disappear (loss of biodiversity).

**d) Overusing Land and Chemicals in Farming (কৃষিজমির অত্যধিক ব্যবহার):**
*   **What happens?** Farmers use too much chemical fertilizer and pesticide to grow more crops from the same piece of land.
*   **How does it harm the environment?** These chemicals sink into the soil and poison it. When it rains, these chemicals are washed into rivers and ponds, polluting the water and harming aquatic life.

**e) Natural Disasters (প্রাকৃতিক দুর্যোগ):**
*   **What happens?** Bangladesh suffers from frequent floods, cyclones, and river erosion.
*   **How does it harm the environment?** These disasters destroy crops, wash away houses and farmland, and make river water salty in coastal areas. This salinization makes the land unfit for farming.

### **2. Major Environmental Problems in Bangladesh (বাংলাদেশের প্রধান পরিবেশগত সমস্যাগুলো)**

**Simple & Detailed Answer:**

Bangladesh is facing several very serious environmental problems that affect our health, food, and homes.

**a) The Death of Our Rivers (নদী মরণ):**
*   **Problem:** Our rivers, which are our lifeblood, are dying. The Buriganga and Shitalakhya rivers near Dhaka are so polluted that they look black and smell very bad.
*   **Why is it happening?** Factories dump their poisonous waste directly into the rivers. People also throw their household garbage into them.
*   **Result:** The fish in the rivers are dying. The water is too poisonous to use for farming or washing. This creates a huge water crisis.

**b) Dangerous Air in Cities (শহরে বিপজ্জনক বায়ু):**
*   **Problem:** The air in big cities, especially Dhaka, is very dangerous to breathe.
*   **Why is it happening?** The main reasons are smoke from old vehicles, dust from construction sites, and pollution from brick kilns.
*   **Result:** This dirty air causes diseases like asthma, lung problems, and can even lead to early death. The World Bank says about 15,000 people die early each year because of this.

**c) Poison in Drinking Water (খাবার পানিতে বিষ):**
*   **Problem:** There is a double danger in our water.
*   **Arsenic (আর্সেনিক):** Naturally occurring poison in underground water. Millions of tube-wells have arsenic-contaminated water, which causes skin diseases and cancer.
*   **Bacteria (ব্যাকটেরিয়া):** Due to poor sanitation, human and animal waste mixes with groundwater, making it unsafe and causing diseases like diarrhea and cholera.

**d) Forests are Disappearing (বনাঞ্চল উধাও):**
*   **Problem:** Our forest areas are getting smaller every year. We have only 16% forest, but we need at least 25% for a balanced environment.
*   **Result:** The Royal Bengal Tiger in the Sundarbans is losing its home. Without trees, the soil becomes weak, and natural disasters like cyclones become more powerful.

**e) The Big Threat: Climate Change (বড় হুমকি: জলবায়ু পরিবর্তন):**
*   **Problem:** This is the biggest environmental challenge for Bangladesh.
*   **What is happening?**
    *   **Sea-Level Rise:** The sea level is rising because the world is getting warmer. This is slowly sinking the southern coastal areas of Bangladesh.
    *   **More Disasters:** Cyclones and floods are becoming more powerful and frequent.
    *   **Salinity:** Sea water is entering the rivers and farmland in coastal areas, making the soil salty and killing crops.
*   **Result:** It is predicted that millions of people from the coastal areas will lose their homes and become refugees (জলবায়ু শরণার্থী) in their own country.

### **3. National & International Initiatives for Sustainable Environment (টেকসই পরিবেশের জন্য জাতীয় ও আন্তর্জাতিক উদ্যোগ)**

**Simple & Detailed Answer:**

The whole world, including Bangladesh, understands that we must protect our environment. Here is what is being done:

**A. What the World is Doing (আন্তর্জাতিক উদ্যোগ):**

1.  **Kyoto Protocol (কিয়োটো প্রটোকল):**
    *   **What is it?** An agreement where rich, developed countries promised to reduce their pollution (greenhouse gases).
    *   **How does it help Bangladesh?** It created a system called **CDM (Clean Development Mechanism)**. Under this, a company from a rich country can invest in a clean project in Bangladesh (like a solar power plant or a waste management plant) and get credit for reducing pollution. It's a win-win situation.

2.  **IPCC and Paris Agreement (আইপিসিসি ও প্যারিস চুক্তি):**
    *   **IPCC:** A group of the world's top scientists who study climate change and warn everyone about its dangers.
    *   **Paris Agreement:** Almost every country in the world agreed to work together to stop the global temperature from rising too much.

**B. What Bangladesh is Doing (বাংলাদেশের জাতীয় উদ্যোগ):**

Bangladesh is not just sitting idle; it is a global leader in fighting climate change.

1.  **Making Laws and Plans (আইন ও পরিকল্পনা প্রণয়ন):**
    *   **Our Constitution (সংবিধান):** The government has added a new part (Article 18A) that says it is the state's duty to protect the environment for its citizens.
    *   **BCCSAP (বিসিসিএএপি):** This is our main action plan. It's a detailed book that explains what we need to do to survive climate change, like building stronger embankments and developing new crops.
    *   **Climate Change Trust Fund (জলবায়ু ট্রাস্ট তহবিল):** This is amazing. Bangladesh itself has set up a fund with its own money to pay for climate change projects. This shows how serious we are.

2.  **Taking Action on the Ground (মাঠ পর্যায়ে পদক্ষেপ):**
    *   **Building Cyclone Shelters (সাইক্লোন শেল্টার নির্মাণ):** We have built over 2,700 strong concrete buildings in coastal areas where people can take shelter during cyclones. This has saved millions of lives.
    *   **Planting Trees (গাছ লাগানো):** We are planting millions of trees along the coast to create a "green wall" that will protect us from cyclones.
    *   **Inventing New Crops (নতুন ফসল উদ্ভাবন):** Our scientists have created new types of rice that can grow in salty water or can survive being underwater for a few days.

### **4. Mitigation & Adaptation Policies for Climate Change in Bangladesh (বাংলাদেশে জলবায়ু পরিবর্তনের প্রশমন ও অভিযোজন নীতি)**

**Simple & Detailed Answer:**

To fight climate change, we use two main strategies: **Adaptation** and **Mitigation**. Think of it like this: If it starts raining, **adaptation** is using an umbrella, and **mitigation** is trying to stop the rain. Since we cannot stop climate change alone, Bangladesh focuses more on using the "umbrella" – that is, **Adaptation**.

**A. Adaptation (অভিযোজন): Learning to Live with the Changes**

This means changing our way of life to survive the effects of climate change.

1.  **Building Strong Walls and Shelters (শক্ত দেয়াল ও আশ্রয়কেন্দ্র নির্মাণ):**
    *   We are building and repairing thousands of kilometers of embankments along the coast to stop seawater from flooding the land.
    *   We have already built over 2,700 cyclone shelters to protect people during storms.

2.  **Growing Different Crops (ভিন্ন ফসল জন্মানো):**
    *   Since seawater is making coastal land salty, we cannot grow normal rice there. So, our scientists have developed **salinity-tolerant rice** that can grow in slightly salty soil.
    *   In low-lying areas that get flooded, we are promoting **floating gardens**, where people grow vegetables on floating beds of water hyacinth.

3.  **Preparing for Disasters (দুর্যোগের জন্য প্রস্তুতি):**
    *   We have a very good **early warning system**. Before a cyclone hits, we can warn people through radio, TV, and volunteers, so they can move to safety.
    *   We have trained over 40,000 volunteers in coastal villages to help during emergencies.

**B. Mitigation (প্রশমন): Trying to Reduce the Cause**

This means taking actions to reduce our own pollution, even though we are not the main cause of climate change.

1.  **Using Clean Energy (পরিষ্কার শক্তি ব্যবহার):**
    *   We are installing **solar panels** on rooftops in villages that are not connected to the electricity grid. This gives people clean light and power without burning fossil fuels.
    *   We are setting up **biogas plants** that use cow dung to produce gas for cooking, so people don't have to cut down trees for firewood.

2.  **Planting More Trees (আরও গাছ লাগানো):**
    *   Trees absorb the carbon dioxide that causes global warming. So, every tree we plant is a small soldier in the fight against climate change. Our social forestry programs encourage people to plant and care for trees.
