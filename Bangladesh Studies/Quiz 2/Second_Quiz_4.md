# **1. Factors of Environmental Degradation**

(**Environmental Degradation = Damage or destruction of the natural environment → পরিবেশের ক্ষয়/ধ্বংস**)

Environmental degradation happens when human activities or natural causes harm water, air, land, soil, forests, animals, and climate.
(**Bangla:** যখন মানুষের কাজ বা প্রাকৃতিক কারণে পরিবেশের বিভিন্ন অংশ নষ্ট হয়।)

Below are the factors in very simple and detailed form:

---

## **1. Water Pollution (জল দূষণ)**

Water becomes polluted when harmful chemicals, wastes, and germs mix with it.

**Simple reasons:**

* Factories throw dirty chemical waste into rivers.
* Cities release sewage (মলমূত্র) without treatment.
* Fertilizers and pesticides from farms mix with water.
* Arsenic contamination in tube wells.
* Bad well construction causes fecal contamination (মলদূষণ).

**Example:**
Buriganga and Shitalakhya are the most polluted rivers in Bangladesh.

👉 **Keywords:**

* *Effluent* = বর্জ্য পদার্থ
* *Contamination* = দূষণ

---

## **2. Air Pollution (বায়ু দূষণ)**

Air becomes dirty and harmful to breathe.

**Simple reasons:**

* Old and unfit vehicles release smoke.
* Brick kilns produce toxic gases.
* Construction work releases dust.
* Burning of biomass and waste.

**Effect:**
About **15,000 people die early every year** because of air pollution.

👉 **Keyword:** *Emission* = নির্গমন

---

## **3. Noise Pollution (শব্দ দূষণ)**

Too much unwanted sound that harms our ears and health.

**Simple reasons:**

* Traffic horns
* Loud engines of buses and trucks
* Construction activities
* Industrial machines

Noise in many areas of Dhaka is much higher than the safety limit.

---

## **4. River Pollution & Encroachment (নদী দূষণ ও দখল)**

Rivers become polluted, narrow, and weak.

**Reasons:**

* Factories dump waste directly into rivers.
* Human waste is thrown into rivers.
* Illegal river grabbing (নদী দখল) reduces water flow.
* Ships and launches throw oil and garbage.

**Example:**
Buriganga receives 1.5 million m³ industrial waste every day.

---

## **5. Loss of Biodiversity (জীববৈচিত্র্য হ্রাস)**

The number of plants and animals decreases.

**Reasons:**

* Deforestation
* Pollution
* Over-hunting
* Destroying natural habitats
* One-crop plantations reduce plant variety

12 species of wildlife have already become extinct in Bangladesh.

---

## **6. Soil Erosion (মাটি ক্ষয়)**

Top fertile soil washes away.

**Reasons:**

* Cutting hills
* Deforestation
* Heavy rain
* Flash floods

**Effects:**

* Land loses fertility
* Rivers become silted
* Flood increases

---

## **7. Natural Disasters (প্রাকৃতিক দুর্যোগ)**

Floods, cyclones, storms, drought, riverbank erosion damage the environment.

---

## **8. Deforestation (বন উজাড়)**

Trees are destroyed faster than they grow.

**Reasons:**

* Illegal logging
* Using wood as fuel
* Expanding agriculture
* Growing population

Bangladesh has **only 16% forest** but needs **25%** for a healthy environment.

* Fish dying

---

## **2. Air Pollution (বায়ু দূষণ)**

* Dhaka is one of the most polluted cities in the world.
* Brick kilns and old vehicles are major causes.
* Dust from roads and construction is massive.

**Effect:**

* Asthma, breathing problems
* Early death
* Heart diseases

---

## **3. Noise Pollution (শব্দ দূষণ)**

* Horns, traffic jams, construction, and loudspeakers.
* Causes headaches, stress, and hearing loss.

---

## **4. Biodiversity Loss (জীববৈচিত্র্য ধ্বংস)**

* Forests are shrinking.
* Animals and birds lose their homes.
* Hills and wetlands are being destroyed.

---

## **5. Natural Disasters (প্রাকৃতিক দুর্যোগ)**

* Flood, cyclone, drought, river erosion.
* Climate change makes disasters more frequent.

---

## **6. Soil Degradation & Erosion (মাটি ক্ষয় ও অবনতি)**

* Hills are cut down.
* Soil fertility decreases.
* Rivers become filled with sand and silt.

---

## **7. River Encroachment & Drying (নদী দখল ও শুকিয়ে যাওয়া)**

* Illegal structures block rivers.
* Water flow decreases.
* Boats, fisheries, and agriculture are affected.

---

## **8. Deforestation (বন ধ্বংস)**

* Only 16% forest remains.
* Leads to global warming.

---

## **9. Urban Environmental Problems (শহরাঞ্চলের পরিবেশগত সমস্যা)**

* Water logging
* Unplanned buildings
* Waste mismanagement
* Housing shortages
* Traffic jams
* Air & river pollution
