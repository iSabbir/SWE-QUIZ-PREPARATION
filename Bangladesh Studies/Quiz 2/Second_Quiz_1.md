### **1. Factors of Environmental Degradation (পরিবেশগত অবক্ষয়ের কারণসমূহ)**

**Detailed Answer:**
Environmental degradation refers to the deterioration of the environment through the depletion of resources and the destruction of ecosystems. In Bangladesh, this is driven by a combination of natural and human-induced factors.

**A. Human-Induced Factors (মানুষসৃষ্ট কারণ):**
*   **Rapid and Unplanned Urbanization (দ্রুত ও অপরিকল্পিত নগরায়ণ):** The massive migration to cities like Dhaka leads to the destruction of wetlands, forests, and agricultural land. This creates extreme pressure on housing, water, and sanitation, resulting in slums and pollution.
    *   *Bengali Meaning: শহরে জনসংখ্যার চাপ, জলাবদ্ধতা, বস্তির proliferation.*
*   **Industrialization (শিল্পায়ন):** Industries, especially textiles and tanneries, release untreated toxic waste (বিষাক্ত বর্জ্য) directly into rivers (like Buriganga and Shitalakhya) and the air. Traditional brick kilns are a major source of air pollution.
*   **Population Pressure (জনসংখ্যার চাপ):** With over 150 million people in a small area, the demand for resources is immense. This leads to overexploitation of land, deforestation for housing and fuel, and generation of massive waste.
*   **Unsustainable Agricultural Practices (অটেকসই কৃষি পদ্ধতি):** Overuse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides contaminates soil and water. This reduces soil fertility over time and pollutes nearby water bodies.
*   **Deforestation (বন উজাড়):** Forests are cleared for agriculture, settlement, and fuel. The annual deforestation rate is 3.3%, which destroys habitats, reduces biodiversity, and contributes to soil erosion and climate change.

**B. Natural Factors (প্রাকৃতিক কারণ):**
*   **Natural Disasters (প্রাকৃতিক দুর্যোগ):** Bangladesh is highly vulnerable to floods, cyclones, riverbank erosion, and landslides. These events directly degrade the environment by destroying land, salinizing soil, and polluting water sources.
*   **Geographical Vulnerability (ভৌগলিক দুর্বলতা):** Being a low-lying delta, Bangladesh is especially susceptible to sea-level rise and salinity intrusion due to climate change.

### **2. Major Environmental Problems in Bangladesh (বাংলাদেশের প্রধান পরিবেশগত সমস্যাগুলো)**

**Detailed Answer:**
Bangladesh faces a multitude of interconnected environmental problems that threaten public health, food security, and economic development.

1.  **Water Pollution (পানি দূষণ):** This is a critical issue. Major rivers like the Buriganga and Shitalakhya are biologically dead due to industrial and urban waste. Furthermore, groundwater, a primary source of drinking water, is contaminated with **arsenic (আর্সেনিক)** and fecal coliform, creating a massive health crisis.
    *   *Bengali Meaning: নদীতে শিল্পবর্জ্য, আর্সেনিক দূষণ।*

2.  **Air Pollution (বায়ু দূষণ):** Dhaka regularly ranks among the cities with the worst air quality globally. Sources include vehicle emissions, uncontrolled brick kilns, road dust, and construction. This causes about 15,000 premature deaths annually.
    *   *Bengali Meaning: যানবাহনের ধোঁয়া, ইটভাটা, ধুলাবালি।*

3.  **River Pollution and Encroachment (নদী দূষণ ও দখল):** Besides pollution, rivers are dying due to encroachment (দখল) and illegal filling, which reduces their water-holding capacity and worsens flooding.

4.  **Deforestation and Loss of Biodiversity (বন উজাড় ও জীববৈচিত্র্যের ক্ষতি):** Only about 16% of the country has forest cover, far less than the recommended 25%. This has led to the extinction of 12 wildlife species and a severe loss of floral diversity.
    *   *Bengali Meaning: সুন্দরবন সংকট, বন্য প্রাণীর বিলুপ্তি।*

5.  **Soil Erosion and Degradation (মৃত্তিকা ক্ষয় ও অবনতি):** Soil erosion in hilly areas and riverbanks leads to loss of fertile land. Salinity intrusion in coastal areas is making vast tracts of land unsuitable for farming.

6.  **Climate Change Impacts (জলবায়ু পরিবর্তনের প্রভাব):** Bangladesh is on the front line of climate change. Impacts include:
    *   **Sea-Level Rise (সমুদ্রপৃষ্ঠের উচ্চতা বৃদ্ধি):** Projected to inundate 10-15% of the country's land, displacing millions.
    *   **Increased Frequency and Intensity of Disasters (বর্ধিত ঘূর্ণিঝড় ও বন্যা):** More powerful cyclones and floods.
    *   **Salinity Intrusion (লবণাক্ততা):** Affecting agriculture and drinking water in coastal regions.

### **4. Mitigation & Adaptation Policies for Climate Change in Bangladesh (বাংলাদেশে জলবায়ু পরিবর্তনের প্রশমন ও অভিযোজন নীতি)**

**Detailed Answer:**
Bangladesh employs a two-pronged approach: **Mitigation** (reducing the cause of climate change) and **Adaption** (adjusting to its effects). Given its low contribution to global emissions, the focus is heavily on adaptation.

**A. Adaptation Policies (অভিযোজন নীতি - Living with the Changes):**
These are the primary focus for Bangladesh.
1.  **Structural Interventions (কাঠামোগত হস্তক্ষেপ):**
    *   **Coastal Embankments:** Building and strengthening over 7,000 km of embankments to protect against storm surges and salinity.
    *   **Cyclone Shelters:** Constructing and maintaining thousands of shelters to save lives during cyclones.
    *   **Coastal Afforestation:** Planting trees (like in the Coastal Green Belt) to act as a natural barrier against cyclones and erosion.
2.  **Agricultural Adaptation (কৃষি অভিযোজন):**
    *   **Developing Climate-Resilient Crops:** Introducing saline-tolerant, submergence-tolerant, and drought-tolerant varieties of rice and other crops.
    *   **Floating Agriculture:** Promoting traditional bed-based agriculture in waterlogged areas.
3.  **Water Management (পানি ব্যবস্থাপনা):**
    *   Implementing the National Water Management Plan to ensure efficient use of water resources, especially during droughts.
4.  **Community-Based Programs (সম্পদাভিত্তিক কর্মসূচি):**
    *   Training 42,000 volunteers for disaster risk reduction and early warning systems.
5.  **Planning for Displacement (বাস্তুচ্যুতির জন্য পরিকল্পনা):**
    *   Developing strategies to manage climate-induced migration, both internally and abroad.

**B. Mitigation Policies (প্রশমন নীতি - Reducing the Cause):**
Although a minor contributor, Bangladesh is also taking mitigation actions.
1.  **Clean Development Mechanism (CDM):** Participating in CDM projects, such as converting urban waste into compost, which reduces methane emissions and earns carbon credits.
2.  **Promotion of Renewable Energy (নবায়নযোগ্য শক্তির প্রচারণা):** Encouraging solar home systems, biogas plants, and other clean energy sources to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
3.  **Energy Efficiency:** Improving efficiency in industries and promoting energy-saving appliances.

**Key Points & Memory Tricks:**
*   **For Adaptation, think "SAFE":**
    *   **S**helters (Cyclone Shelters)
    *   **A**griculture (Resilient Crops)
    *   **F**ortifications (Embankments)
    *   **E**arly Warning Systems
*   **For Mitigation, think "Clean & Green":**
    *   **C**DM Projects
    *   **G**reen Energy (Solar, Biogas)
*   **Trick:** Remember that Bangladesh is a leader in **Adaptation**. It's about building **Shelters**, **Walls (embankments)**, and **New Crops** to survive. Mitigation is a smaller side project about being **"Clean"**.
