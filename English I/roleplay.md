**(The student knocks on the tutor's office door.)**

**T:** Come in!

**S:** Good morning, Dr. [Tutor's last name]. I'm sorry to bother you, but I was wondering if I could speak to you about something important.

**T:** Good morning. Of course, come in and sit down. What can I help you with?

**S:** Thank you. Uh, I came to see you because I have a little problem with tomorrow's essay deadline.

**T:** Uh-huh.

**S:** For the essay, uh, the question is... since the beginning, since I started preparing the assignment, I always wanted to put some data from my own country to... to make the essay richer and more interesting for me. But there's a problem with a specific book I needed to search for... to get information from. It was borrowed, and there's only one copy in the library.

**T:** I see.

**S:** So, it was borrowed a long time ago, and I recalled it, but I could only have access to the book, uh... yesterday. So, as the deadline for the essay... the essay is tomorrow, I think it will be impossible for me to read the book and analyze it and write the essay for tomorrow. My guess is that I will need at least two more days, um, to do that, and probably I will only be able to hand in the assignment on Monday.

**T:** Hmm. And how much of the essay have you finished already?

**S:** Um, basically... I only need to put in that data from the book. Apart from that, everything is almost done, so... it's only that part remaining.

**T:** Hmm, could you write it more... more quickly? Because I'm very busy next week. I have no time to mark the essay, I think. I want to mark all the students' essays together this weekend, and uh, it's fair to other students if I can't do this work this weekend, um, the other students can't get their essay back.

**S:** Hm, yes, I understand, I understand, but... I reckon that I think it will only be possible for me to finish the essay on Sunday. Um... uh, maybe I don't know, but um... you could mark all the other papers on the weekend, and uh... then you will only have mine to mark.

**T:** Yeah, but you're asking for Monday.

**S:** Yes, on Monday.

**T:** No, I couldn't mark it on Monday. I have a... I have a meet... I have a meeting that day.

**S:** Uh-huh.

**T:** So I think it's better if you hand in your homework before the Sunday.

**S:** Uh-huh.

**T:** So I can have some time to mark it.

**S:** Hmhm. Is there any chance of getting an extension for this essay until Monday? I really did everything I could to get hold of the book, but the library only returned it yesterday.

**T:** This isn't the first time you've asked for an extension, is it? You had one earlier this term when you were ill.

**S:** I know I have already had an extension, but this situation is a bit different, as it was out of my control with the library book.

**T:** But it's a question of fairness. I have to think about the other students who met the deadline. You should have had plenty of time to prepare for this essay. Why didn't you come to tell me about this problem earlier?

**S:** I only got the book back yesterday, so I couldn't have informed you sooner about the delay with that specific resource. I tried my best to get it back quickly.

**T:** Well, I appreciate your problem, but an extension until Monday is very difficult. I simply won't have time to mark it then.

**S:** So, you think, uh... I can only hand in the assignment on Saturday?

**T:** Yeah.

**S:** It's not possible on Sunday or Monday?

**T:** I think it's not possible.

**S:** Uh... all right. I'll... do my best. I'll try to hand it...

**T:** Ok. Hand it in on Saturday. Will you be around in the university?

**S:** Yes.

**T:** Yes, I will be in my office on Saturday afternoon, so you can hand it to my office.

**S:** Hmhm, all right, hmhm. I'll try. Thank you very much.
