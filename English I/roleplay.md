**(The student knocks on the tutor's office door.)**

**T:** Come in!

**S:** Good morning, Dr. Mahbubul. Do you have a moment? I'm sorry to bother you, but I wanted to discuss the essay deadline for tomorrow.

**T:** Good morning, Sabbit. Of course, please come in. What's on your mind about the essay?

**S:** Thank you. Well, I've been working really hard on it, but I've run into a bit of a snag regarding a specific book from my home country that I wanted to use to make the essay richer. There was only one copy in the university library, and it was borrowed for quite a while.

**T:** Ah, yes, the library can sometimes be a challenge with popular resources.

**S:** Exactly. I requested it back, and it only became available yesterday. With the deadline being tomorrow, I just don't think I'll have enough time to properly read, analyse, and integrate the information from it. I estimate I'd need at least two more days, which would mean handing it in on Monday.

**T:** I appreciate you coming to me and explaining the situation, and I understand how frustrating it can be to get hold of essential research materials. It sounds like you've put a lot of effort into this.

**S:** I really have! Apart from incorporating the information from that one book, the rest of the essay is pretty much done.

**T:** Right. Now, as you know, I tend to be quite strict about deadlines. It's important for fairness to all the students, especially since I'm planning to do all the marking this weekend before my conference next week. And you did have an extension earlier this term for another essay when you were unwell, which we were happy to grant.

**S:** I understand, and I'm grateful for that earlier extension. I wouldn't be asking again if it wasn't for this unexpected delay with the library book. I genuinely did everything I could to get hold of it as soon as possible.

**T:** I believe you. However, pushing the deadline to Monday really isn't feasible for my marking schedule, and I need to ensure consistency for everyone. I can't really make a full extension without impacting the other students getting their work back.

**S:** I see. So, no flexibility at all for this particular circumstance?

**T:** Here's what I can offer, given your proactive approach and the genuine difficulty with the library book. I can accept your essay late, but in line with my usual policy for late submissions without exceptional circumstances, there would be a **10% deduction from the final mark**.

**S:** A 10% deduction...

**T:** Yes. This allows you the extra time you need to properly integrate the research, which sounds important for the quality of your essay, without completely disrupting the marking schedule for the rest of the class. You could aim to hand it in on Sunday, or perhaps Monday morning at the very latest, knowing that the deduction would apply.

**S:** So, even if I hand it in on Sunday, it would still be a 10% deduction?

**T:** That's correct. The deadline is tomorrow, Friday, at 5 p.m. Anything submitted after that time would fall under the late submission policy with the 10% deduction. It's a way for me to acknowledge the difficulty you faced while still upholding the academic structure.

**S:** Hmm. I really don't feel that my work would be good enough without that book. So, the choice is either a lower mark due to incomplete research by tomorrow, or a 10% deduction for a more comprehensive essay by Sunday/Monday.

**T:** Precisely. It's about weighing your options. If the book is truly vital to the quality of your essay, then the deduction might be a trade-off for a stronger overall piece. You should have plenty of time over the weekend to finish it properly if you choose that route.

**S:** All right, Dr. [Tutor's last name]. I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this and offering an alternative. I'll aim to submit it on Sunday then, understanding the deduction.

**T:** Very good. Just ensure you still submit it via the usual channel, and it will be noted. If you have any further questions as you finish it, please don't hesitate to email.

**S:** Thank you again. I will.

**T:** You're welcome. Good luck with the final touches on your essay.
