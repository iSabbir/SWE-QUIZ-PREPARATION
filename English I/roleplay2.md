*Student:** May I come in, Professor?

**Teacher:** Yes, please. What is it?

**Student:** I would like to ask if I could have more time to finish my essay, maybe until Monday.

**Teacher:** The essay is due tomorrow. Why do you need more time?

**Student:** Sir, I was actually waiting for a library book. I got it only yesterday, and I need two more days to read it properly.

**Teacher:** You already had an extension earlier. I have a lot of marking this weekend.

**Student:** I understand, sir. If it is not possible, I will submit what I have by tomorrow.

**Teacher:** Very well. Submit by Monday, but 10% will be deducted.

**Student:** Sir, if 10% is deducted, it will really hurt my mid-term marks. I have worked hard on this essay.

**Teacher:** Hmm… You have been diligent with your work and this seems to be a special case.

**Student:** Yes, sir. I will surely submit by Monday.

**Teacher:** It would be better for you if you could submit by Monday. But if you can’t, I won’t accept the essay. I will decide about the marks if it comes on Monday.

**Student:** Thank you very much, Sir. I really appreciate it.

**Teacher:** Very well. Make sure you do.

**Student:** Yes, Sir. Thank you again. Goodbye!
