# **Member 1 – Arib: Introduction**
*Role: The Introductory Paragraph (Hook, Background Info, Definition, and Thesis).*

## **Slide 1: Title Slide**
* **Visuals:** Title text clearly displayed; university logo; names and IDs of all 6 group members. A background image showing a montage of Bangladeshi children (some in school uniforms, some working).
* **Speaker Script:**
   "Good morning, respected teacher and classmates. Our team is here to discuss a critical socioeconomic issue that plagues our nation. Our topic is 'The Causes and Effects of Child Labour in Bangladesh.' This presentation is structured as a formal essay, where we will examine the root causes, the devastating consequences, and the potential solutions to this pervasive problem."

## **Slide 2: Meaning of Child Labour**
* **Visuals:** Definition bullet points; specific focus on "physical, mental, and emotional harm." An icon of a crossed-out school bag next to a tool.
* **Speaker Script:**
   "To begin, we must define our terms. Child labour is not merely children helping with household chores; it refers to the exploitation of children through any form of work that deprives them of their childhood. It is work that interferes with their ability to attend regular school and is mentally, physically, socially, or morally dangerous. Essentially, if an activity stops a child from picking up a book and forces them to pick up a brick instead, it is classified as child labour."

## **Slide 3: Why This Topic Is Important**
* **Visuals:** An infographic showing a map of Bangladesh with icons representing different industries (Garments, Brickfields, Agriculture).
* **Speaker Script:**
   "Why does this matter? Child labour is not just a personal tragedy; it is a national crisis. It affects millions of young minds across Bangladesh, effectively blocking the development of our future workforce. By prioritizing immediate low-wage labor over education, we risk 'destroying childhood' and stifling the intellectual potential of the next generation. Understanding this issue is the first step toward safeguarding our country’s future."

## **Slide 4: Current Facts and Statistics**
* **Visuals:** Bar chart based on *Labour Force Survey 2022*. Highlight "3.5 Million Total" and "1 Million Hazardous."
* **Speaker Script:**
   "Statistical evidence underscores the gravity of the situation. According to the Labour Force Survey of 2022, approximately 3.5 million children aged 5 to 17 are currently working in Bangladesh. More alarmingly, over 1 million of these children are engaged in hazardous labour—sectors like brick kilns, metal workshops, and transport—that pose immediate threats to their lives. These numbers represent millions of unfulfilled dreams."

## **Slide 5: Thesis Statement**
* **Visuals:** A flowchart graphic: Causes -> Effects -> Solutions.
* **Speaker Script:**
   "This leads to the primary argument of our presentation. We assert that while child labour is driven by complex factors such as extreme poverty and deep-rooted social norms, it results in a cycle of illiteracy and poor health that harms the nation. Therefore, this presentation will first analyze the economic causes, then discuss the adverse effects on individuals and society, and finally, propose comprehensive government and social solutions to eradicate this practice."

# **Member 2 – Nafis: Cause 1 – Poverty and Social Pressure**
*Role: First Body Paragraph (Primary Causation - Economic).*

## **Slide 1: Poverty – The Main Reason**
* **Visuals:** Photo of a family in a slum setting; text stressing "Survival Strategy."
* **Speaker Script:**
   "We turn now to the primary cause of child labour: extreme poverty. For many families in Bangladesh, sending a child to work is not a choice, but a survival strategy. When parents cannot afford basic necessities such as food, shelter, and medicine, children are viewed as economic assets. They become 'extra earners' whose meager wages are often the difference between starvation and survival for the entire household."

## **Slide 2: Real Story Example**
* **Visuals:** A silhouette or an illustrative drawing of a boy working at a tea stall with a clock showing 12 hours passing.
* **Speaker Script:**
   "To illustrate this point, consider the case of a 12-year-old boy working at a tea stall in Dhaka. He labours for 12 hours a day, pouring hot water and washing dishes, yet his earnings are significant only because his family is destitute. His reality contradicts the universal right to childhood, yet he continues because his parents are financially dependent on his income. This anecdote highlights how poverty forces premature adulthood upon children."

## **Slide 3: Social and Cultural Pressure**
* **Visuals:** Contrast image: A child looking at a book vs. a child holding a plow. Text: "Tradition vs. Education."
* **Speaker Script:**
   "Beyond economics, social and cultural pressures play a significant role. particularly in rural Bangladesh. There is a prevailing belief among some communities that 'learning a trade' at a young age is more practical than formal education. Consequently, parents may prioritize skill acquisition in farming or mechanics over schooling, mistakenly believing that early entry into the workforce guarantees financial security."

## **Slide 4: The Informal Job Market**
* **Visuals:** Photos of informal sectors: Street hawkers, small workshops, domestic help. Text: "No Contracts, No Safety."
* **Speaker Script:**
   "Furthermore, the structure of Bangladesh's economy contributes to the problem. A vast portion of our economy is 'informal'—including tea stalls, street vendors, and home-based factories. In these unregulated environments, there are no employment contracts and no safety inspections. Employers prefer children because they are cheap, obedient, and unlikely to demand their rights, making exploitation incredibly easy and widespread."

# **Member 3 – Debapriya: Cause 2 – Lack of Access to Education**
*Role: Second Body Paragraph (Secondary Causation - Structural/Institutional).*

## **Slide 1: Education Is Not Fully Free**
* **Visuals:** An image of a free textbook balanced against a heavy pile of money labeled "Uniforms, Coaching, Transport."
* **Speaker Script:**
   "The second major cause acts as a barrier to the solution: the lack of accessible, affordable education. While the government provides free primary schooling, there are substantial 'hidden costs.' Poor families struggle to pay for uniforms, stationery, exam fees, and private tutoring. These financial burdens often force parents to withdraw their children from school, pushing them toward the labor market instead."

## **Slide 2: School Attendance Is Low**
* **Visuals:** Pie chart showing 28-29% attendance for working children vs. non-working.
* **Speaker Script:**
   "The correlation between labor and school dropout rates is undeniable. Data indicates that only about 28 to 29 percent of working children are able to continue their education. For the vast majority, starting work marks the permanent end of their academic journey. The inability to balance long work hours with school schedules results in a massive dropout rate."

## **Slide 3: Parental Mindset**
* **Visuals:** Thought bubble of a parent: "School = ??? vs Work = Cash Today."
* **Speaker Script:**
   "This issue is compounded by a lack of awareness among parents. Many illiterate parents do not visualize the long-term return on investment that education offers. They view schooling as a time-consuming luxury that does not generate immediate income. Without strong community engagement to change this mindset, the preference for immediate wages will continue to outweigh the value of a degree."

## **Slide 4: Distance & Quality Issues**
* **Visuals:** Photo of a dilapidated classroom or students walking a long mud road.
* **Speaker Script:**
   "Finally, we must address the infrastructure of our education system. In remote areas, schools may be situated kilometers away, making attendance difficult. Moreover, when classrooms are overcrowded, facilities are poor, and teachers are untrained, children feel discouraged. When a child perceives school as an unpleasant or useless environment, the temptation to leave school and start earning becomes much stronger."

# **Member 4 – Parthee: Effects of Child Labour**
*Role: Third Body Paragraph (Consequences/Effects).*

## **Slide 1: Loss of Education**
* **Visuals:** A blocked road sign labeled "Future Opportunities."
* **Speaker Script:**
   "Moving from causes to effects, the most immediate consequence of child labour is the loss of education. When children work, they miss out on literacy, numeracy, and critical thinking skills. This lack of education creates a ceiling on their future potential, restricting them to low-skilled, low-wage jobs for the rest of their lives. Essentially, they are denied the tools needed to improve their social standing."

## **Slide 2: Health Problems**
* **Visuals:** Medical icons representing lungs (dust), skeleton (heavy loads), and malnutrition.
* **Speaker Script:**
   "Physically, the toll is often permanent. Children working in hazardous sectors, such as brickfields or chemical factories, are exposed to toxic substances, heavy lifting, and dangerous machinery. This leads to chronic conditions including respiratory diseases, musculoskeletal injuries, and malnutrition. By subjecting growing bodies to such harsh conditions, we are physically damaging the next generation."

## **Slide 3: Emotional Stress**
* **Visuals:** Image of a child looking isolated/sad. Keywords: "Anxiety, Abuse, No Play."
* **Speaker Script:**
   "The psychological impact is equally severe yet often overlooked. Working children suffer from immense stress, exhaustion, and anxiety. They are stripped of the time to play and socialize, which is crucial for emotional development. Furthermore, many in domestic or factory work face verbal and physical abuse, leaving them with deep emotional scars and trauma."

## **Slide 4: Generational Poverty Cycle**
* **Visuals:** Cycle Diagram: Poor Parents -> Child works/No School -> Low Income Adult -> Poor Parents.
* **Speaker Script:**
   "Ultimately, the cumulative effect of these individual tragedies is a societal trap known as the 'Generational Poverty Cycle.' A child who works instead of learning grows up to be an impoverished adult without skills. Consequently, they are forced to send their own children to work, repeating the cycle. Unless we break this chain, poverty will persist generation after generation."

# **Member 5 – Tajbiha: Solutions**
*Role: Fourth Body Paragraph (Recommendations/Counter-measures).*

## **Slide 1: Government Actions**
* **Visuals:** Image of a gavel (Law) and an inspector visiting a factory.
* **Speaker Script:**
   "How can we solve this crisis? The first line of defense is the government. We need strict enforcement of existing child labour laws. The government must increase the number of factory inspections and impose severe penalties on employers who exploit children. Legal deterrence is essential to reducing the demand for cheap child labour."

## **Slide 2: Improve Education Access**
* **Visuals:** Icons of "Free Lunch," "Scholarship," and "Bus."
* **Speaker Script:**
   "Secondly, education must become truly accessible to the poor. This involves more than just tuition-free admission. We propose comprehensive support systems such as free textbooks, uniforms, and transportation subsidies. Additionally, implementing 'Mid-day Meal' programs in schools serves two purposes: it combats malnutrition and provides a strong incentive for parents to keep their children in class."

## **Slide 3: Support for Families**
* **Visuals:** Hands holding a safety net. Text: "Financial Aid & Skill Training."
* **Speaker Script:**
   "Since poverty is the root cause, we must support the families directly. Social safety nets, such as cash stipends for families who send their children to school, can compensate for the lost income of the child. Furthermore, offering skill development programs for the parents can help them secure better-paying jobs, negating the need for their children to work."

## **Slide 4: NGO & Community Role**
* **Visuals:** Logo of NGOs (like BRAC or UNICEF). Image of a community meeting.
* **Speaker Script:**
   "Finally, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and community groups play a vital role. NGOs can spearhead the rescue of children from hazardous conditions and provide informal, flexible schooling to help them catch up. Simultaneously, community leaders must raise awareness to shift the cultural mindset, helping parents understand that education is an investment, not a cost."

# **Member 6 – Sabbir: Conclusion**
*Role: Concluding Paragraph (Summary, Synthesis, and Final Thought).*

## **Slide 1: Summary of Key Points**
* **Visuals:** Bullet list summarizing: Causes (Poverty/Education) -> Effects (Health/Cycle) -> Solutions (Policy/Support).
* **Speaker Script:**
   "In conclusion, we have explored the multifaceted issue of child labour in Bangladesh. We established that the root causes lie in crushing poverty, social pressure, and barriers to education. We examined the devastating effects, ranging from physical health hazards to the perpetuation of the poverty cycle. And we outlined necessary solutions, focusing on legal enforcement, educational reform, and economic support for families."

## **Slide 2: Hope for the Future**
* **Visuals:** Upward trend graph representing "School Enrollment."
* **Speaker Script:**
   "Despite the challenges, there is hope. Bangladesh has made significant strides in recent years, and with continued cooperation between the government, civil society, and international bodies, progress is accelerating. By implementing the solutions we discussed, it is entirely possible to break the cycle and return these children to where they belong."

## **Slide 3: Final Message**
* **Visuals:** Large, bold quote: "Children belong in classrooms and playgrounds—not in the workforce."
* **Speaker Script:**
   "We leave you with this final thought: The development of a nation is judged by how it treats its most vulnerable members. It is our collective responsibility to ensure that every child holds a pen instead of a tool. As our presentation emphasizes: 'Children belong in classrooms and playgrounds—not in the workforce.'"

## **Slide 4: Thank You**
* **Visuals:** "Thank You!" graphics. Contact info/References listed in small text.
* **Speaker Script:**
   "Thank you very much for your attention. We hope this essay-styled presentation has provided a clear and deep understanding of the situation. We are now open to any questions you may have regarding our analysis."
