# Dialogue: Request for English Courses

<dialogue role="conversation" location="Language Centre Office">
  <turn speaker="Student" tone="polite">
    Hello sir, I’m sorry to bother you, but I wanted to ask about the English courses.
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Director" tone="calm">
    That’s fine. What is the problem?
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Student" tone="worried">
    I am a bit worried about my English level. Everyone else on my course is a native speaker, so I feel I am at a disadvantage.
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Director" tone="reassuring">
    I see. But your scores are all above 60%. The problem is that we must give priority to students with lower scores.
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Student" tone="concerned">
    Yes, I understand. But I really don’t feel my English is good enough. I only got just over 60. In my home country I usually get over 80%. 
    I want to improve more, especially before classes get difficult.
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Director" tone="inquisitive">
    Have you any reason to think you have serious language problems?
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Student" tone="explaining">
    Since I arrived, I find lectures hard to follow. Some teachers speak very fast. Also, reading long texts takes me much longer than other students. I think the evening courses would help me a lot.
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Director" tone="empathetic">
    I understand your worry. But this year many students need the classes, so the places are very limited.
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Student" tone="pleading">
    Then why can’t I have a place, even if my score is a little higher?
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Director" tone="firm">
    Because we must help the students with scores below 60% first. This is our rule every year.
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Student" tone="resigned">
    I see. Is there anything else I can do?
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Director" tone="helpful">
    Yes. Instead of coming to classes, why not join our self-study sessions in the Language Centre? We have listening rooms, reading practice, writing support, and teachers who can give advice.
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Student" tone="hopeful">
    That sounds helpful.
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Director" tone="informative">
    Also, I can put your name on the waiting list. If there are free places in week 3, I will contact you. Someone with 61% has higher priority than someone with 67%, so you may get a place.
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Student" tone="grateful">
    Thank you, sir. I appreciate your help.
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Director" tone="closing">
    You’re welcome. I think you should try the self-study for now, and we will see if a place opens later.
