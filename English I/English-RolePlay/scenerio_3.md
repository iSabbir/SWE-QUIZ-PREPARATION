# Dialogue: Student and Librarian

<dialogue role="conversation" location="Department Library">
  <turn speaker="Student" tone="polite">
    Hello, excuse me. I was wondering whether I could borrow some books today.
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Librarian" tone="apologetic">
    Hello. I’m afraid we are not lending books this week.
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Student" tone="requesting">
    Can I explain my problem?
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Librarian" tone="open">
    Of course. Go ahead.
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Student" tone="explaining">
    I finished my pre-sessional English course last week. This week I need to read the books on my reading list for my degree. My department says we must read the main books before the term starts.
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Librarian" tone="informative">
    I understand. But I am doing stocktaking this week, and the assistant librarian is on holiday. So I decided not to lend books until next week.
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Student" tone="insistent">
    I can see you’re busy, but I really need the books now. If I wait until next week, it will be too late for me to finish the reading.
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Librarian" tone="firm">
    I appreciate your problem, but if I make one exception, then many other students will also ask.
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Student" tone="inquiring">
    I understand. But is there a rule that says I can’t borrow? Or is it just for this week?
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Librarian" tone="clarifying">
    It is my decision for this week only. I need quiet time to finish the stocktaking.
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Student" tone="concerned">
    Is there anything I can do? Some of the books in the bookshop are too expensive for me.
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Librarian" tone="suggesting">
    Well, couldn’t you use the main university library? It is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and they may have some of the books.
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Student" tone="explaining">
    Yes, I can try that. But some books are only available here in this department library.
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Librarian" tone="considering">
    Hmm… How about this: perhaps I can lend you one book overnight. You must return it tomorrow at 2 p.m. when we open.
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Student" tone="grateful">
    That would help a lot. Even one book is very useful. Thank you so much!
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Librarian" tone="kind">
    All right. Choose one book, and I’ll write your name down. Please return it on time.
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Student" tone="thankful">
    I will. Thank you again for your kindness.
  </turn>
