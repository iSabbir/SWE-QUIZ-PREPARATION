# Dialogue: Request for an Essay Extension

<dialogue role="conversation" location="Professor's Office">
  <turn speaker="Student" tone="polite">
    May I come in, Professor?
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Teacher" tone="neutral">
    Yes, please. What is it?
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Student" tone="requesting">
    I would like to ask if I could have more time to finish my essay, maybe until Monday.
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Teacher" tone="questioning">
    The essay is due tomorrow. Why do you need more time?
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Student" tone="explaining">
    Sir, I was actually waiting for a library book. I got it only yesterday, and I need two more days to read it properly.
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Teacher" tone="firm">
    You already had an extension earlier. I have a lot of marking this weekend.
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Student" tone="understanding">
    I understand, sir. If it is not possible, I will submit what I have by tomorrow.
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Teacher" tone="deciding">
    Very well. Submit by Monday, but 10% will be deducted.
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Student" tone="concerned">
    Sir, if 10% is deducted, it will really hurt my mid-term marks. I have worked hard on this essay.
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Teacher" tone="considering">
    Hmm… You have been diligent with your work and this seems to be a special case.
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Student" tone="reassuring">
    Yes, sir. I will surely submit by Monday.
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Teacher" tone="warning">
    It would be better for you if you could submit by Monday. But if you can’t, I won’t accept the essay. I will decide about the marks if it comes on Monday.
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Student" tone="grateful">
    Thank you very much, Sir. I really appreciate it.
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Teacher" tone="closing">
    Very well. Make sure you do.
  </turn>

  <turn speaker="Student" tone="polite">
    Yes, Sir. Thank you again. Goodbye!
  </turn>
