### Scenario 1: Deadline for an Essay
**Roles:** Student vs. Tutor
[cite_start]**Context:** The student cannot finish an assignment on time and asks for more time[cite: 340].

**Student:** Good morning, Sir. Do you have a moment to speak with me?

**Tutor:** Good morning. Yes, I have a few minutes. What can I do for you?

**Student:** I am worried about the history essay that is due tomorrow. I am afraid I cannot finish it on time.

**Tutor:** Oh really? You know that the deadline was set two weeks ago. Why haven’t you finished it yet?

**Student:** I am very sorry. I actually finished all my research last week. However, I got a very bad fever three days ago. I was in bed and could not look at my computer screen because my head hurt very much.

**Tutor:** I see. I am sorry to hear that you were sick. Are you feeling better now?

**Student:** Yes, I am feeling much better today. But I still need to write the final part of the essay. I don't want to rush it and do a bad job.

**Tutor:** I understand. Usually, I do not like to change the deadline. But since you were sick, I can make an exception this time.

**Student:** Thank you so much, Sir. That is very kind of you.

**Tutor:** How much extra time do you need?

**Student:** If I could have two more days, that would be perfect. Can I submit it on Friday morning?

**Tutor:** That is fine. Please bring it to my office before 10:00 AM on Friday.

**Student:** I will definitely be there. Thank you for understanding my situation.

**Tutor:** You are welcome. Just make sure to manage your time well for the next assignment.

### Scenario 2: Language Centre
**Roles:** Student vs. Language Course Director
[cite_start]**Context:** A student wants information about joining a language course[cite: 341, 349].

**Student:** Hello. Excuse me, are you the Director of the language courses?

**Director:** Yes, I am. Good afternoon. How can I help you today?

**Student:** Good afternoon. My name is Sarah. I am a new student at the university. I want to join an English class to improve my skills.

**Director:** Welcome to the university, Sarah. We have many different classes here. What specific skill do you want to practice? Do you want to learn grammar, writing, or speaking?

**Student:** My grammar is okay, but I am very shy when I speak. I want to improve my speaking and listening. Do you have a class for conversation?

**Director:** Yes, we do. We have a "Speaking Skills" course. It is very popular. In this class, students practice talking in pairs and groups. It is very fun and relaxed.

**Student:** That sounds perfect for me. When does the class meet?

**Director:** The class meets two times a week. It is on Mondays and Wednesdays from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Does that time work with your schedule?

**Student:** Let me think. Yes, I am free at that time. Do I need to buy a specific book for this class?

**Director:** No, you do not need a book. The teacher will give you worksheets in the class. You just need to bring a notebook and a pen.

**Student:** That is great. How do I sign up for the class?

**Director:** You can fill out this form right now. The next course starts next Monday.

**Student:** Okay, I will fill it out. Thank you very much for your help.

**Director:** You are welcome. We look forward to seeing you in class!

### Scenario 3: Library
**Roles:** Student vs. Librarian
[cite_start]**Context:** A student is looking for a book but cannot find it on the shelf[cite: 342, 343].

**Student:** Excuse me, Ma'am? Could you please help me?

**Librarian:** Hello. Sure, what do you need help with?

**Student:** I am trying to find a book for my biology project. I looked up the book on the library computer, and it says the book is available.

**Librarian:** Okay. Did you write down the call number of the book? That number tells you where the book lives on the shelf.

**Student:** Yes, I did. I went to the science section and found the right shelf. I looked very carefully, but the book is not there. The spot is empty.

**Librarian:** That is strange. If the computer says "Available," it should be on the shelf. Maybe another student is using it inside the library right now and hasn't checked it out yet. Or perhaps someone put it back in the wrong place.

**Student:** Oh, I see. Is there any way to find it? I really need it for my homework this weekend.

**Librarian:** Let me go with you to the shelf. Sometimes books are hiding behind other books.

*(They walk to the shelf)*

**Librarian:** Let's look here. Ah, look at this! It was put on the shelf below the correct one. Here is your book.

**Student:** Oh, wow! Thank you so much. I didn't see it down there.

**Librarian:** No problem. It happens often. Do you want to check this out now?

**Student:** Yes, please. How long can I keep it?

**Librarian:** You can keep it for two weeks. Just bring your student ID card to the front desk.

**Student:** Okay, I will go there now. Thanks again for finding it for me.

**Librarian:** You are welcome. Have a good day!
