### Part A: Reading Comprehension (Expository)

**Read the passage carefully and answer the following questions:**

**The Revolution of Green Energy**

**Paragraph A:** For over a century, the world has relied heavily on fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas to power industries and homes. While these resources drove the Industrial Revolution, they have come at a steep environmental cost. The burning of fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, which traps heat in the atmosphere. This process is the primary driver of global warming, leading to extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and changing ecosystems.

**Paragraph B:** In response to this crisis, the world is turning toward renewable energy sources, often called "green energy." Unlike finite fossil fuels, renewable energy is generated from natural sources that replenish themselves. The most prominent examples include solar power, harvested from the sun's rays, and wind energy, captured by massive turbines. These sources produce electricity without emitting harmful pollutants, offering a cleaner alternative for a sustainable future.

**Paragraph C:** However, the transition is not without hurdles. One major challenge is intermittency; the sun does not always shine, and the wind does not always blow. This requires the development of advanced battery storage systems to save excess energy for later use. Additionally, the initial infrastructure cost for building solar farms and wind parks is high, although these costs are decreasing as technology improves and becomes more widespread.

**Paragraph D:** Another promising sector is hydropower and geothermal energy. Hydropower uses the flow of water in rivers and dams to spin turbines, while geothermal energy taps into the heat generated beneath the Earth's crust. While highly effective, these methods are often location-dependent. For instance, geothermal energy is most viable in volcanically active regions, restricting its global application compared to solar or wind.

**Paragraph E:** Ultimately, the shift to green energy is not just a technological challenge but a necessary evolution for survival. Governments, corporations, and individuals are beginning to realize that investing in renewables is investing in the longevity of the planet. While the road ahead involves complex economic and logistical adjustments, the destination—a carbon-neutral world—is essential for the next generation.

**1. a) Select the most suitable headings for the given paragraphs from the list below. Write the appropriate number (I-VII) next to Paragraphs A-E.** [5x1=5]

### Part B: Reading Comprehension (Biographical)

**Read the passage below and answer the questions.**

**The Journey of J.K. Rowling**

Joanne Rowling, known worldwide as J.K. Rowling, was born on July 31, 1965, in Yate, England. From a young age, she had a vivid imagination and wrote fantasy stories which she read to her younger sister. However, her early adulthood was marked by struggle. After university, she worked as a researcher for Amnesty International, but the idea for *Harry Potter* came to her in 1990 while she was waiting for a delayed train from Manchester to London.

Over the next few years, her mother passed away, and Rowling moved to Portugal to teach English. There, she married and had a daughter, but the marriage ended shortly after. She returned to the UK, settling in Edinburgh, Scotland, with no job and very little money. Living on state benefits, she spent her days in local cafes, writing the first novel while her baby slept beside her.

Completing the manuscript was only half the battle. The book, *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, was rejected by twelve different publishing houses. Editors felt a children's book about wizards would not sell well. Finally, a small publisher, Bloomsbury, accepted it, largely because the chairman’s eight-year-old daughter loved the first chapter.

Published in 1997, the book became an instant phenomenon. It won numerous awards and launched a series that would sell over 500 million copies globally. Today, J.K. Rowling is one of the best-selling authors in history, proving that perseverance in the face of rejection can lead to extraordinary success.

**2. Trace the answer to the following questions. Choose NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS from the passage for each answer.** [5x1=5]

i.  Where did the idea for *Harry Potter* first come to Rowling?
ii. Which country did Rowling move to in order to teach English?
iii. Where did she write while her baby slept?
iv. How many publishers rejected her first manuscript?
v.  Who convinced the Bloomsbury chairman to accept the book?
