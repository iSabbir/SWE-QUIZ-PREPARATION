### Read the passage carefully and answer the following questions.

#### Passage: “Learning Smarter with Micro-Habits”

**Paragraph A:** Many students think improvement needs big changes—new routines, long study hours, and strict schedules. But research and real-life experience show that small actions, repeated daily, can create powerful results. These small actions are often called micro-habits.

**Paragraph B:** A micro-habit is a tiny behavior that takes less than two minutes to start. For example, opening your notebook and writing one sentence, or solving one math problem. The goal is not to finish everything at once, but to build consistency. Once consistency becomes automatic, larger effort feels easier.

**Paragraph C:** People fail not because they are lazy, but because they depend on motivation. Motivation is unstable—it goes up and down. Micro-habits reduce the need for motivation by making tasks too small to resist. This is why they are useful during exams, stress, or low-energy days.

**Paragraph D:** Micro-habits work best when you attach them to something you already do. This is called “habit stacking.” For example: after brushing your teeth, you read two lines of English; after lunch, you revise one definition. The old habit becomes a trigger for the new one.

**Paragraph E:** Over time, micro-habits improve confidence. When students see daily progress, they stop fearing big tasks. They also learn self-control and planning. In the long run, the method builds a strong learning identity: “I’m someone who studies daily.”

## 3(a) Letter (Sample – exam style, short but solid)

**Dear [Friend’s Name],**
Hope you’re doing great. I’m excited to know you’ll visit my area next month. I suggest you stay at a nearby guesthouse/hotel around the main town area because it is safe and you can find transport easily.

You should visit the local park, the river-side area, and the main market for street food and souvenirs. If you like taking photos, evening time is perfect because the lights look beautiful.

One negative side is that traffic can be heavy during rush hours, so it’s better to go out a bit early.

Please let me know your schedule. I’ll be happy to guide you.
**Yours lovingly,**
[Your Name]
