## Formal Letter Writing Topics

### 1. Letter to a Magazine Editor

**The Editor**
International Travel Magazine
123 Travel Lane
London, UK

**Subject: Correction Regarding an Article on Dhanmondi, Dhaka**

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to you as a regular reader and a resident of Dhaka, regarding an article titled "A Walk Through Old Dhaka's Charm" published in your recent June issue. While I appreciate the coverage of my city, I must point out a significant error in the information provided about my hometown, Dhanmondi.

The article incorrectly describes Dhanmondi as a part of "Old Dhaka" and characterizes it by its ancient architecture and bustling narrow lanes. In reality, Dhanmondi is a modern, planned residential area in the newer part of the city, known for its serene lake, contemporary architecture, cafes, and art galleries. This misrepresentation could mislead tourists, giving them inaccurate expectations and potentially causing them to miss the actual historic sites of Old Dhaka, which are located much further south.

It is crucial for a prestigious publication like yours to provide accurate information, as travelers from all over the world rely on your content to plan their trips and form their impressions of a place. Inaccurate details not only diminish the credibility of your magazine but also do a disservice to the cities you feature by misrepresenting their unique character.

To rectify this, I suggest you publish a correction in your next issue and update the online version of the article. Furthermore, a follow-up feature that accurately portrays the distinct identities of both Old Dhaka and modern neighborhoods like Dhanmondi would be a wonderful way to provide a richer, more authentic picture of our diverse city.

Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

Yours faithfully,

[Your Name]

### 2. Letter to an Internet Service Provider

**The Manager**
Customer Service Department
ConnectNet ISP
456 Gulshan Avenue
Dhaka, Bangladesh

**Subject: Persistent Internet Connectivity Issues in the Mohammadpur Area**

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to you on behalf of several residents in the Mohammadpur area to formally complain about the severe and persistent issues with our internet connection over the past three weeks.

The problems we are facing are multifaceted. Firstly, the internet speed is drastically lower than the advertised 100 Mbps, often dropping to less than 10 Mbps, which makes streaming and video conferencing impossible. Secondly, we are experiencing intermittent connection dropouts, which occur multiple times a day without warning. These issues are affecting a wide range of customers in our locality.

This unreliable service is having a significant negative impact on our daily lives. Many of us are students or professionals who rely on a stable internet connection for online classes, exams, and working from home. These disruptions have caused missed deadlines, poor academic performance, and professional setbacks. The constant instability is a source of immense frustration and is hampering our ability to function effectively in this digital age.

We urge you to take immediate action to resolve this situation. We request that you dispatch a technical team to investigate the root cause of the problem in our area, whether it is a faulty line or an issue at the local exchange. We expect a permanent solution and a clear communication from your end regarding the timeline for this fix. We believe some compensation for the period of disruption would also be appropriate.

We look forward to your prompt response and a swift resolution.

Yours faithfully,

[Your Name]

### 3. Letter to a Family for a Job

**Mr. and Mrs. Smith**
15 Ocean View Road
Sydney, Australia

**Subject: Application for Childcare Position**

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Smith,

I am writing with great enthusiasm in response to your advertisement in the "Aussie Weekly" magazine for a live-in child carer for your six-year-old child for a period of six months.

I would love to take on this job because I have a genuine passion for working with children and am eager to experience Australian family life and culture. I am currently a university student, and the opportunity to immerse myself in a new country while doing something I enjoy is incredibly appealing. This experience would be invaluable for my personal growth and would allow me to save for my future studies.

I believe I would be a very suitable person for you to employ. I have over three years of experience as a part-time babysitter for two families in my neighborhood, where I cared for children between the ages of four and eight. I am responsible, patient, and creative, and I enjoy planning engaging activities such as arts and crafts, reading, and outdoor games. I am also trained in basic first aid and am a non-smoker.

During my free time in Australia, I would love to explore the natural beauty of the country. I am an avid hiker and swimmer and would be excited to visit your famous beaches and national parks. I am also keen to join a local art class to meet new people and learn a new skill.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review and am available for a video interview at your earliest convenience.

Yours sincerely,

[Your Name]

### 4. Letter to the City Council

**The Head of the City Council**
Dhaka City Council
Nagar Bhaban, Dhaka

**Subject: A Proposal to Preserve the Historic Rose Garden Palace**

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to you today as a concerned citizen regarding the recent proposal to demolish the historic Rose Garden Palace in our city. I understand that this decision is being considered due to a lack of funds for its renovation, but I strongly believe that demolishing this landmark would be an irreversible loss for our community.

The Rose Garden Palace is not just an old building; it is a vital piece of our city's heritage. It is one of the few remaining examples of colonial-era architecture in our region and stands as a physical testament to our rich history. For generations, it has been an iconic landmark that gives our town its unique character and provides a tangible link to our past.

Renovating this building, rather than demolishing it, would preserve this cultural asset for future generations. An expertly restored Rose Garden Palace could be repurposed as a vibrant cultural hub—a museum, an art gallery, or a community event space. This would not only save our history but also create a valuable public resource and a potential tourist attraction that could boost our local economy.

To address the funding issue, I propose that the council initiate a public-private partnership. We could launch a "Save the Palace" fundraising campaign to gather donations from citizens and local businesses who value our heritage. We could also seek grants from historical preservation societies and cultural organizations. For its future maintenance, a small entry fee for visitors or rental fees for events could generate a sustainable income stream.

I urge you to reconsider the plan for demolition and work with the community to find a creative solution to preserve this invaluable piece of our history.

Yours faithfully,

[Your Name]

### 5. Letter to a Train Company

**Customer Service Manager**
National Rail Services
Central Station, Dhaka

**Subject: Complaint Regarding Unusable Tickets and Unhelpful Staff**

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with a recent experience I had with your train service. On June 10th, I purchased two advance tickets for a journey from Dhaka to Chittagong for June 17th. However, my attempt to travel was met with an entirely preventable and frustrating problem.

When I arrived at the station on the morning of June 17th to board the 8:00 AM train, I was informed by the platform attendant that my tickets were invalid for that service. Apparently, the schedule had been changed, and my tickets were for a train that no longer ran at that time. I received no prior notification of this change via email or text, despite providing my contact details during the booking.

What made the situation worse was the unhelpful and dismissive attitude of the staff at the ticket counter. When I explained the issue, the employee was rude, offered no apology, and simply stated that it was my responsibility to check for schedule changes. He made no effort to find a solution, such as booking me on the next available train, and I was forced to buy two new, expensive last-minute tickets to make my urgent journey.

I expect a full refund for the two original tickets that I was unable to use. Furthermore, I suggest you take immediate action to improve your communication system to ensure all passengers are automatically notified of schedule changes. Your staff also require urgent training in customer service to ensure they treat passengers with respect and offer constructive help.

I have attached copies of both the original and newly purchased tickets. I look forward to your prompt response and a satisfactory resolution to this matter.

Yours faithfully,

[Your Name]

### 6. Letter to a Course Provider

**The Accommodation Officer**
Global Study Program
100 Education Street
London, UK

**Subject: Urgent Problem with Arranged Accommodation**

Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is [Your Name], and I am a student from Bangladesh currently enrolled in your International Business course, which started last week. I am writing to report a serious issue with the accommodation that was arranged for me by your program at 15 Park Road.

The primary problem is that the accommodation is in a state of disrepair. The heating system is not working, and with the cold weather, the room is uninhabitable. Additionally, the shared kitchen facilities are unhygienic, and there is a significant mold problem in the bathroom. This is a serious health and safety concern and is making it very difficult for me to settle in and focus on my studies.

When I booked this course, the brochure described the accommodation as a "modern, fully-equipped single room with private amenities in a clean and safe student residence." The reality is a stark contrast to this description. I was expecting a functional, clean, and private living space, which is not what has been provided.

I request that you resolve this issue urgently. I would like to be moved to alternative accommodation that meets the standard advertised in your materials as soon as possible. I have already tried speaking to the building manager, but nothing has been done. I trust that you will treat this matter with the seriousness it deserves.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this issue.

Yours sincerely,

[Your Name]

## Informal Letter Writing Topics

### 1. Letter to a Friend about a Sports Match

Hey [Friend's Name],

Hope you're recovering well and not feeling too down about missing the game last Saturday. We definitely missed having you on the field.

You'll be pleased to hear that we managed to pull off a win! It was a close one, though—we beat the Titans 3-2 in the end. The final goal was scored in the last two minutes, so the whole thing was incredibly tense. You would have loved the drama!

The weather was absolutely wild that day. It was sunny when we started, but halfway through the second half, the heavens opened and it started pouring rain. The pitch got so muddy and slippery, and everyone was sliding all over the place. It made the game chaotic but also kind of hilarious to watch.

Honestly, it felt a bit strange playing without you. The victory felt a little hollow because you weren't there to celebrate with us. It just wasn't the same. We all kept saying how we wished you were there. Everyone on the team is thinking of you and hoping you get back on your feet soon.

Rest up and take it easy. Let me know if you need anything.

Best,

[Your Name]

### 2. Letter to a Friend about a Business Offer

Hi [Friend's Name],

Thanks so much for the letter and for thinking of me as a partner for your new business. I was so excited to read about your idea, and I have to say, I've been thinking about it nonstop ever since.

First off, I think your business idea is absolutely brilliant. A personalized meal-kit delivery service that focuses on local, organic ingredients is exactly what our city needs. You've clearly done your research, and your passion for healthy food really shines through. I have no doubt that it's going to be a huge success.

This has been a really tough decision for me, but after a lot of thought, I've decided that I won't be able to accept your offer to be a partner at this time.

The reason is that I've just accepted a promotion at my current job, which is going to involve a lot more responsibility and travel over the next year. As much as I would love to build this business with you, I know I wouldn't be able to give it the 100% commitment it deserves right now, and that wouldn't be fair to you. It honestly breaks my heart to say no, because I believe in this project so much.

Please don't be discouraged! You have an amazing plan, and I'll be your number one customer and supporter from day one. Let's catch up for coffee next week—I'd love to hear more about your next steps.

All the best,

[Your Name]

### 3. Letter to a Friend Recommending a Holiday Destination

Hey [Friend's Name],

Great to hear from you! It's so exciting that you're planning a holiday. You asked for a recommendation, and I immediately thought of the trip I took to Saint Martin's Island in Bangladesh last year. It was incredible, and I think you'd love it.

It's a small coral island in the Bay of Bengal, and it's genuinely one of the most beautiful, relaxing places I've ever been. We stayed in a lovely little beachside cottage at a place called "Blue Marine Resort." It was simple but clean, and we fell asleep to the sound of the waves every night. The best thing to do there is just relax on the pristine beaches, go snorkeling to see the coral and colorful fish, and eat amazing fresh seafood, especially the grilled lobster. In the evening, you can sit on the beach and watch the sunset—it’s magical.

The only negative aspect I would mention is that it can get a bit crowded with tourists during the peak season, especially on weekends. So, if you can, I'd recommend trying to go on a weekday to get a more peaceful experience.

Hope this helps you make a decision! Let me know what you think.

Cheers,

[Your Name]

### 4. Letter to a Classmate about a Borrowed Book

Hi [Classmate's Name],

I hope you had a great holiday and a safe trip back home.

I'm writing to you because I've made a bit of a silly mistake, and I wanted to apologize. I've just realized that I still have the important economics textbook I borrowed from you at the end of last term. I am so sorry about this! I completely forgot it was in my bag when I was packing up, and I should have made sure to return it to you before we left.

How important is the book to you right now? I'm worried that you might need it for your own studies or that you were planning to sell it. Please let me know if my having it is causing you any trouble.

Of course, I want to get it back to you as soon as possible. I can send it to you by courier right away. If you send me your address, I'll have it packaged up and shipped out by tomorrow morning, and I'll make sure to cover all the postage costs.

Again, I'm really sorry for my carelessness.

Best wishes,

[Your Name]

### 5. Letter to a Friend with Tour Recommendations

Hey [Friend's Name],

It was great to get your letter and hear that your cousins are coming to visit next week! That's awesome news. I'd be happy to give you some recommendations for their tour of the area.

For a place to stay, I'd suggest they look for a hotel or guesthouse in the Banani or Gulshan area. It's a really nice part of the city, very safe and clean, and it's full of great restaurants, cafes, and shops. It's also well-connected to other parts of the city, so it would be a convenient base for them to explore from.

As for spots to visit, they should definitely spend a day exploring Old Dhaka. They can visit historic places like Lalbagh Fort and Ahsan Manzil, and try some of the famous local food there. They might also enjoy a relaxing boat ride on the Buriganga River. For something more modern, they could visit the Liberation War Museum to learn about our country's history or spend an afternoon at the National Parliament House, which has amazing architecture.

I'd love to meet up with them while they're here! How about I take them out for a traditional Bangladeshi dinner one evening? Just let me know which day works best for them.

Hope they have a fantastic trip!

Best,

[Your Name]

### 6. Letter to a Friend Offering Holiday Advice

Hi [Friend's Name],

I was so happy to get your letter and hear that you're planning to spend two weeks in my region! I'm already looking forward to you coming.

You mentioned you need a place to stay, and you don't have to worry about that at all. I can definitely help you find somewhere. Just let me know what your budget is like, and whether you'd prefer a hotel in the city center or maybe a quieter guesthouse. My parents also said you're more than welcome to stay with us for a few days if you'd like!

There's so much to do here! We could spend a couple of days exploring the historic parts of the city, and then maybe take a day trip out to the countryside to see some of the tea gardens. There's also a great national park nearby where we can go for a hike if you're feeling adventurous. And, of course, I'll have to take you to all my favorite local restaurants.

Regarding clothes, it will be quite warm and a bit humid during that time of year, so you should bring lightweight things like t-shirts, shorts, and light trousers. A pair of comfortable walking shoes is a must. It might also be a good idea to pack a light waterproof jacket, as we sometimes get unexpected rain showers in the afternoon.

Just let me know your travel dates, and we can start planning everything. I'm so excited to see you!

Best wishes,

[Your Name]
