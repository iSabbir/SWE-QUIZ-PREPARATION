### Part A: Reading Comprehension (Expository)

**Read the passage carefully and answer the following questions:**

**The Rise of Remote Work**

**Paragraph A:** The concept of the workplace has undergone a radical transformation in recent years. Traditionally, employment was synonymous with a physical office—a place where employees gathered from nine to five. However, the advent of high-speed internet and collaborative software has shifted this paradigm. Remote work, once a perk for the few, has become a standard operating model for companies worldwide, fundamentally changing how we define professional life.

**Paragraph B:** One of the most cited benefits of remote work is the flexibility it offers. Employees can tailor their work environments to their personal needs, leading to increased job satisfaction. Without the daily commute, workers save hours each week, which can be reinvested into family, hobbies, or rest. This balance often results in higher productivity, as workers feel less stressed and more in control of their schedules.

**Paragraph C:** However, the shift is not without its challenges. Critics argue that remote work erodes company culture and creates a sense of isolation among team members. The lack of spontaneous "water cooler" conversations can hinder creativity and bond-building. Furthermore, the blurring of lines between home and work can lead to burnout, as employees find it difficult to "switch off" when their living room is also their office.

**Paragraph D:** To mitigate these issues, organizations are adopting hybrid models. This approach requires employees to be in the office for a set number of days while allowing them to work from home for the remainder. This strategy aims to capture the best of both worlds: the collaboration and social interaction of the office, combined with the flexibility and autonomy of remote work.

**Paragraph E:** In conclusion, the future of work is unlikely to return strictly to the past. As technology evolves, so too will our working habits. Whether fully remote or hybrid, the focus has shifted from *where* we work to *how* we work most effectively. Adaptation will be key for both employers and employees navigating this new landscape.

### Part B: Reading Comprehension (Biographical/Narrative)

**Read the passage below and answer the questions.**

**The Life of Marie Curie**

Marie Curie was born Maria Sklodowska on November 7, 1867, in Warsaw, Poland. Her parents were both teachers who believed strongly in education. However, Poland was under Russian rule at the time, and women were not allowed to attend university. Determined to study, Marie and her sister Bronya made a pact: Marie would work to support Bronya’s medical studies in Paris, and then Bronya would support Marie.

In 1891, Marie finally moved to Paris and enrolled at the Sorbonne. She lived in a drafty attic and survived on tea and bread, but she was happy to be learning. There, she met Pierre Curie, a brilliant physicist. They married in 1895 and became scientific partners. Together, they investigated radioactivity, a term Marie coined.

Working in a makeshift laboratory in a shed, they processed tons of pitchblende ore. In 1898, they announced the discovery of two new elements: polonium (named after Marie's homeland) and radium. In 1903, the Curies, along with Henri Becquerel, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. Marie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize.

Tragedy struck in 1906 when Pierre was killed in a street accident. Despite her grief, Marie took over his teaching post, becoming the first female professor at the Sorbonne. She continued her research and won a second Nobel Prize in 1911, this time in Chemistry, for isolating pure radium. During World War I, she developed mobile X-ray units to help wounded soldiers. Marie Curie died in 1934 from aplastic anemia, caused by prolonged exposure to radiation.

**2. Trace the answer to the following questions. Choose NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS from the passage for each answer.** [5x1=5]

i.  What country was Marie Curie originally from?
ii. Where did Marie enroll in 1891?
iii. What did the Curies process to find new elements?
iv. Which element was named after Poland?
v.  What caused Marie Curie's death?
