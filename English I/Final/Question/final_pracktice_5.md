## 1. Read the passage carefully and answer the following questions. (15 marks)

### Passage–1: **“The Science of Building Better Focus”**

**A.** Many people believe focus is something you either have or you don’t. But psychologists say focus is a skill, and like any skill, it can be trained. The brain adapts to what you repeatedly practice, so attention improves when you work with clear structure.

**B.** One major enemy of focus is constant switching. When you check messages, open new tabs, and return to your task again, your brain pays a “restart cost.” Even if the switch takes a few seconds, the recovery of deep attention can take much longer.

**C.** A practical solution is time-blocking: you decide one task, set a small time limit, and protect that period from interruptions. A short, protected session often produces more output than a long session filled with breaks and distractions.

**D.** Focus also depends on the environment. A quiet space, a clean desk, and a simple to-do list reduce mental noise. Even small changes—like turning off notifications—can make a noticeable difference.

**E.** Over time, consistent focus training changes your identity. Instead of saying “I can’t concentrate,” you start thinking “I’m improving.” This belief supports long-term discipline and helps people handle difficult tasks with less stress.

## Passage–2: **“Plastic to Pavement”**

A city introduced a program where **waste plastic** is mixed with bitumen to build stronger roads. Engineers found that plastic-mixed roads can resist water damage better than normal roads.

However, officials warned that only certain types of plastic are safe for this process, and strict monitoring is required.

4. Paragraph D — **V**
5. Paragraph E — **VI**

**বাংলা ব্যাখ্যা (কীভাবে মিলাবে):**

* **A** বলছে focus শেখা/ট্রেন করা যায় → brain learns focus → **I**
* **B** বলছে tab/message switch করলে “restart cost” → multitasking cost → **II**

* Passage-1 এ স্পষ্টভাবে বলা: focus “skill” এবং practice করলে improve হয় → i = **B**
* switching এর পর deep attention ফিরতে সময় লাগে → “restart cost” = task switch-এ time loss → ii = **B**
* time-blocking = one task + protected time → iii = **B**
* clean desk/quiet/notifications off → mental noise কমে → iv = **B**
* consistent training identity বদলায় (“I’m improving”) + discipline → v = **B**

## 3(a) Letter (7) — Sample Answer

**Dear Friend,**
Hope you’re doing well. Since you’re planning a holiday, I strongly recommend **Cox’s Bazar** because it has a long sea beach, great food, and relaxing views. I stayed in a mid-range hotel near the beach so it was easy to walk to the shore and visit nearby spots.

You can enjoy sunrise walks, try local seafood, and take short trips to Himchari or Inani. If you like photos, evening time is perfect.

One negative aspect is that it can be crowded during peak season, and prices may go up, so booking early is a smart idea.

**Yours lovingly,**
[Your Name]

**বাংলা ব্যাখ্যা (কেন ৭/৭ আসতে পারে):**

* ৩টা bullet requirement একদম clear: destination + stay/activities + one negative point

## 3(b) Essay (8) — Sample (Topic 2)

### **Should parents limit screen time for kids?**

Screen time has become a normal part of children’s daily life because of online classes, entertainment, and social media. However, unlimited screen use can harm both physical and mental health. Therefore, parents should limit screen time in a balanced and practical way.

First, too much screen time reduces physical activity. Kids may avoid outdoor play, which can lead to obesity, weak eyesight, and poor sleep. Second, excessive use of short videos and games weakens attention span. As a result, children may struggle to focus on study or reading. Third, uncontrolled internet access can expose kids to harmful content and online addiction.

However, screen time is not always bad. Educational videos, learning apps, and research can improve skills if used correctly. That is why the best solution is controlled use. Parents can set daily time limits, keep devices away during meals and bedtime, and encourage sports, hobbies, and family conversations.

In conclusion, parents should limit screen time, not to punish kids, but to protect their health and support balanced development.

**বাংলা ব্যাখ্যা (৮ নম্বরের জন্য):**

* examples + logical flow আছে, তাই marking সহজ হয়
