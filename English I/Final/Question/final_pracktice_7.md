## **Part–1: Reading (15 marks)**

### Passage–1: *“The Value of Time Management”*

**A.** Time is one of the most valuable resources in human life. Unlike money, time cannot be saved or recovered once it is wasted. Therefore, managing time properly is essential for success in both academic and personal life.

**B.** Many students struggle with time management because they underestimate small activities. Scrolling social media or watching short videos may seem harmless, but these habits slowly consume hours every day without notice.

**C.** Effective time management starts with planning. When tasks are written down and prioritized, the mind becomes less stressed. A simple daily schedule helps students focus on what truly matters.

**D.** Another important factor is discipline. Even the best plan fails without self-control. Students who follow their schedules regularly achieve better results and feel more confident about their abilities.

**E.** In the long run, good time management builds responsibility and balance. People learn to work efficiently while still having time for rest, family, and personal growth.
