## **Part–1: Reading (15 marks)**

### Passage–1: *“Why Failure Is Necessary for Success”*

**A.** Many students fear failure and try to avoid it at all costs. They believe failure means weakness or lack of ability. However, psychologists argue that failure is a natural part of learning and growth.

**B.** When people fail, they receive feedback. This feedback shows what went wrong and what needs improvement. Without mistakes, learners often repeat the same ineffective methods without realizing it.

**C.** Successful individuals usually fail more times than others. The difference is that they analyze their failure instead of giving up. They treat failure as information, not as a final judgment.

**D.** Education systems that punish failure too harshly can discourage creativity. Students become afraid to try new ideas and prefer safe answers. As a result, real learning slows down.

**E.** When failure is accepted as a learning tool, students become more confident. They take responsibility for their progress and develop resilience, which helps them face future challenges.

## **3(a) Letter (7 – Sample)**

**Dear Brother,**
I hope you are well. As your university exams are near, you should follow a regular study routine. Divide your subjects wisely and study a little every day instead of studying everything at the last moment.

Revision is very important because it helps you remember key points and reduces exam fear. Make short notes and revise them regularly. One common mistake students make is ignoring weak subjects, which increases pressure later.

Stay confident and take care of your health.
**Yours lovingly,**
[Your Name]

## **3(b) Essay (8 – Sample: Topic 1)**

### *The Importance of Learning from Failure*

Failure is often seen as something negative, but in reality, it is one of the greatest teachers in life. Every failure provides valuable lessons that help people grow and improve.

When people fail, they understand their weaknesses and mistakes. This helps them change their strategies and avoid repeating the same errors. Many successful individuals have failed multiple times before achieving success, but they never stopped trying.

Failure also builds mental strength. People who learn from failure become more confident and resilient. They are not afraid of challenges and are better prepared for future difficulties.

In conclusion, failure should not be feared. Instead, it should be accepted as a necessary step toward success and personal development.
