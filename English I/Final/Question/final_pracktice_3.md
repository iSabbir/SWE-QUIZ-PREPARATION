### Part A: Reading Comprehension (Expository)

**Read the passage carefully and answer the following questions:**

**The Silent Threat: Plastic Pollution**

**Paragraph A:** Plastic has become an inseparable part of modern life. It is lightweight, durable, and cheap to produce, making it the material of choice for everything from food packaging to medical devices. However, this convenience comes with a significant downside. Since plastic is not biodegradable, it does not decompose naturally. Instead, it persists in the environment for hundreds of years, accumulating in landfills and natural habitats at an alarming rate.

**Paragraph B:** The most visible impact of this pollution is found in our oceans. Every year, millions of tons of plastic waste enter marine ecosystems, often carried by rivers or blown from coastal regions. Large garbage patches, such as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, have formed where ocean currents trap debris. These floating islands of trash cover vast areas, turning pristine waters into toxic soups of waste.

**Paragraph C:** Marine wildlife suffers immensely from this invasion. Animals such as sea turtles often mistake plastic bags for jellyfish, their primary food source. When ingested, the plastic blocks their digestive systems, leading to starvation. Similarly, birds and fish become entangled in discarded fishing nets and six-pack rings, which can cause severe injuries, immobility, or drowning.

**Paragraph D:** A less visible but equally dangerous threat comes from microplastics. Over time, larger plastic items break down into tiny particles measuring less than five millimeters. These microplastics are ingested by plankton and small fish, eventually moving up the food chain to larger predators and, ultimately, humans. Research suggests that consuming seafood contaminated with microplastics may pose health risks to people, although the long-term effects are still being studied.

**Paragraph E:** Addressing this global crisis requires a multi-faceted approach. Governments are beginning to implement bans on single-use plastics like straws and bags. Simultaneously, scientists are developing biodegradable alternatives made from plant materials. However, the most effective solution lies in changing consumer behavior—reducing consumption and recycling effectively are crucial steps toward a plastic-free ocean.

**1. a) Select the most suitable headings for the given paragraphs from the list below. Write the appropriate number (I-VII) next to Paragraphs A-E.** [5x1=5]

### Part B: Reading Comprehension (Narrative/Biographical)

**Read the passage below and answer the questions.**

**Malala: A Voice for Education**

Malala Yousafzai was born on July 12, 1997, in Mingora, a town in the Swat Valley of Pakistan. Her father, Ziauddin, was a teacher who ran a girls' school and believed strongly that women should have the same rights as men. When Malala was ten years old, the Taliban took control of the Swat Valley and banned girls from attending school.

Despite the danger, Malala refused to stay silent. In early 2009, she began writing a blog for the BBC under a pseudonym (a fake name), describing her life under Taliban rule and her desire to go to school. Her voice grew louder, and she began appearing on television to advocate for female education. This made her a target. On October 9, 2012, while riding the bus home from school, a gunman boarded the vehicle and shot her.

Malala survived the attack but was in critical condition. She was flown to Birmingham, England, for specialized medical treatment. Her recovery was miraculous. Instead of retreating into fear, she used her global platform to continue her fight. On her 16th birthday, she gave a famous speech at the United Nations, declaring that "One child, one teacher, one book, and one pen can change the world."

In 2014, at the age of 17, Malala became the youngest-ever recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. She continues to work today through the Malala Fund, an organization dedicated to ensuring every girl around the world has access to twelve years of free, safe, and quality education.

**2. Trace the answer to the following questions. Choose NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS from the passage for each answer.** [5x1=5]

i.  In which valley was Malala born?
ii. Who did Malala write a blog for in 2009?
iii. What did the gunman attack while Malala was riding it?
iv. To which city was she flown for medical treatment?
v.  What prize did she receive in 2014?
