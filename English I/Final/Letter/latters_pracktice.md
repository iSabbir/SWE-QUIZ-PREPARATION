## 1️⃣ Ten Formal Letters

### Formal Letter 1 – Complaint to a Hotel (Noise Problem)

**Dear Sir / Madam,**

I am writing in connection with my recent stay at your hotel from 3rd to 6th December in Room 407. Unfortunately, my experience was disappointing due to constant noise at night.

Each evening, loud music was played from the bar on the ground floor until after midnight. The sound travelled clearly to my room, making it extremely difficult to sleep. I had specifically requested a quiet room as I was in the city for an important conference and needed rest.

I reported the issue twice to the reception desk, but no effective solution was provided. I had to use earplugs and stay awake much later than planned, which affected my performance at the conference.

I kindly request a partial refund of my room charges and an assurance that better soundproofing or stricter noise control will be implemented.

Yours faithfully,
SABBIR

### Formal Letter 2 – Complaint to a Restaurant (Food & Service)

**Dear Sir / Madam,**

I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the meal and service I received at your restaurant on 25th November at around 8 p.m.

My family and I ordered three main courses and two desserts. Unfortunately, the food arrived cold and undercooked, especially the grilled chicken, which appeared pink in the middle. When we informed the waiter, he seemed uninterested and simply reheated the same dish instead of preparing a fresh one.

Due to this, we felt uncomfortable eating the meal and had to leave earlier than planned. This was particularly disappointing as we had come to celebrate a birthday based on your restaurant’s good reputation.

I would appreciate it if you could investigate this matter, ensure better quality control in your kitchen and provide us with a voucher or compensation so that we may give your restaurant another chance.

Yours faithfully,
SABBIR

### Formal Letter 3 – Letter to Bank (Lost Bank Card)

**Dear Sir / Madam,**

I am writing to inform you that I have lost my debit card connected to my savings account, number 12345678, and to request urgent assistance.

Yesterday evening, 5th December, I realised that my card was missing from my wallet. I last used it at an ATM near Green Park at approximately 4 p.m. Since then, I have not been able to locate it and I am concerned that it may have been stolen.

I kindly request that you block this card immediately to prevent any unauthorised transactions. In addition, please issue a replacement card and send it to my registered address as soon as possible. I would also be grateful if you could provide me with a statement of recent transactions so that I can check for any suspicious activity.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Yours faithfully,
SABBIR

### Formal Letter 4 – Request to University (Deferring Admission)

**Dear Sir / Madam,**

I am writing regarding my admission to the Master of Computer Science programme, scheduled to begin in February 2026, in order to request a one-year deferral.

Due to unexpected family circumstances, I am currently required to remain in my home country to support my parents. My father has recently experienced serious health issues and needs continuous care. As the eldest child, I must assist with hospital visits and day-to-day responsibilities.

Given this situation, I would be grateful if you could allow me to defer my admission until the February 2027 intake. I remain very interested in joining your programme and I am fully committed to pursuing my studies once my family situation stabilises.

Please let me know if any additional documents are required to support my request.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours faithfully,
SABBIR

### Formal Letter 5 – Letter to Landlord (Repair Request)

**Dear Sir / Madam,**

I am writing in connection with a serious maintenance issue in the apartment I rent at 14B, Rose Street.

For the past two weeks, there has been a persistent leak in the bathroom ceiling. As a result, water collects on the floor, creating a slippery and unsafe environment. In addition, there is now visible mould around the affected area, which may pose a health risk.

I reported this issue by phone on 22nd November, but no repair work has been carried out so far. I kindly request that you arrange for a plumber to inspect and fix the leak as soon as possible and have the damaged ceiling properly cleaned and repainted.

If this matter is not resolved promptly, I may be forced to contact the local housing authority for further assistance.

Thank you for your prompt attention.

Yours faithfully,
SABBIR

### Formal Letter 6 – Letter to Airline (Delayed Luggage)

**Dear Sir / Madam,**

I am writing to complain about the delay in receiving my luggage following my recent flight with your airline on 30th November, Flight XY234 from Dubai to London.

Upon arrival at London Heathrow, my suitcase did not appear on the baggage carousel. I reported this immediately at the baggage desk and was informed that my luggage would be delivered to my address within 48 hours. However, it has now been five days and I have still not received it.

The suitcase contains important personal items and winter clothing, which I urgently need. I have already had to purchase essential items at my own expense.

I request that you locate and deliver my luggage as soon as possible and reimburse me for the emergency purchases I have made. Please find attached copies of my receipts.

I look forward to your swift response.

Yours faithfully,
SABBIR

### Formal Letter 7 – Letter to Company (Job Application)

**Dear Sir / Madam,**

I am writing to apply for the position of Junior Software Developer advertised on your company website on 1st December.

I recently completed my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, where I developed strong skills in Python, JavaScript and database management. During my final year project, I designed a web application for managing student data, which improved processing speed and accuracy for faculty members.

I am particularly interested in your organisation because of its focus on innovative solutions and professional growth. I believe that my technical skills, combined with my enthusiasm for learning, would enable me to contribute positively to your development team.

I have attached my curriculum vitae and academic transcripts for your consideration. I would be grateful for the opportunity to attend an interview and discuss my application in more detail.

Thank you for your time.

Yours faithfully,
SABBIR

### Formal Letter 8 – Letter to City Council (Public Park Issue)

**Dear Sir / Madam,**

I am writing to draw your attention to the poor condition of the public park located on Lakeview Road in our neighbourhood.

Over the last few months, the park has become increasingly dirty and unsafe. There is rubbish scattered around the benches, broken glass near the children’s play area and several damaged swings. In addition, the park lights are not functioning properly at night, which discourages families from visiting.

This situation is particularly disappointing as the park is one of the few recreational spaces available to local residents. It should be a clean and safe environment where children can play and adults can exercise.

I kindly request that the council organise a thorough cleaning of the park, repair the broken equipment and ensure that the lighting system is fixed. Regular maintenance checks would also be helpful.

Thank you for considering this request.

Yours faithfully,
SABBIR

### Formal Letter 9 – Letter to Library (New Membership & Facilities)

**Dear Sir / Madam,**

I am writing to enquire about the procedure for obtaining membership at your public library and to ask for some information about your facilities.

I have recently moved to this city and would like to make use of your library for research and personal reading. Could you please inform me about the documents required for registration, the annual membership fee and the maximum number of books that can be borrowed at a time?

Furthermore, I would appreciate details regarding your opening hours, availability of study rooms and access to digital resources such as e-books and online journals.

I look forward to receiving your response so that I can complete the membership process at the earliest.

Yours faithfully,
SABBIR

### Formal Letter 10 – Letter to Course Provider (Requesting Refund)

**Dear Sir / Madam,**

I am writing in connection with the online English course that I recently enrolled in through your website on 10th November.

According to the course description, live classes were to be held three times a week and all sessions would be recorded for later viewing. However, during the past three weeks, more than half of the scheduled classes were cancelled without prior notice, and no recordings have been uploaded.

As a working professional, I joined this course to improve my communication skills and carefully planned my time around the timetable provided. The frequent cancellations have caused great inconvenience and I feel that I have not received the service promised.

Therefore, I kindly request a full refund of the course fee. I would also suggest that you improve your communication with students regarding any changes in schedule.

Yours faithfully,
SABBIR

## 2️⃣ Ten Informal Letters

### Informal Letter 1 – Thanking a Friend for Help with Studies

**Dear Rafi,**

Thanks so much for helping me with my programming assignment last week. I honestly don’t know how I would have finished it on time without your support.

I was really confused about the database part, but the way you explained the tables and relationships made everything much clearer. Because of your guidance, I managed to submit the project before the deadline and my teacher seemed quite impressed.

Next time you’re free, come over to my place and we can work on your project together. I’d be happy to return the favour and help you with any topic you find difficult. We can also order some snacks and make it a fun study session.

Take care and stay in touch!

Warm wishes,
SABBIR

### Informal Letter 2 – Inviting a Friend to a Birthday Party

**Dear Anika,**

I hope you’re doing great! I’m writing to invite you to my birthday party this Saturday at my home.

I’m planning a small get-together with close friends. We’ll have music, games and of course a big chocolate cake. The party will start around 5 p.m. and continue into the evening, so come whenever you’re free after your classes.

It has been a long time since we last met, and I really miss our crazy conversations. Please try your best to come. It wouldn’t feel complete without you there.

Let me know if you need directions or want to come together from campus.

Best regards,
SABBIR

### Informal Letter 3 – Apologising for Not Keeping in Touch

**Dear Sajal,**

I’m really sorry I haven’t written to you for such a long time. Life has been quite hectic recently and I kept postponing my reply.

My university exams just finished last week, and for the past month I was completely buried in books. On top of that, I started a part-time job in the evenings, so I barely had any free time. Still, I know that’s not a good excuse for disappearing like this.

How have you been? I saw some of your photos on social media and it looks like you’ve been travelling a lot. When you have time, tell me all about your recent trip.

From now on, I’ll try to message you more regularly. Our friendship means a lot to me.

Warm wishes,
SABBIR

### Informal Letter 4 – Describing a New City to a Friend

**Dear Nidhi,**

Guess what? I finally moved to the new city I told you about, and it’s even more exciting than I expected!

My apartment is small but cosy, and it’s only ten minutes away from the main market. The streets are always busy with people, street food stalls and colourful lights. In the evenings, there’s live music near the central square, which gives the whole place a really lively atmosphere.

The best part is my new office. The team is friendly, and my manager is very supportive. I’m learning a lot every day and I feel like I made the right decision coming here.

You should definitely visit when you get a break from your studies. I’d love to show you around and explore the cafes together.

Take care and write back soon.

Best regards,
SABBIR

### Informal Letter 5 – Congratulating a Friend on a New Job

**Dear Farhan,**

I just heard the amazing news that you got the job at the software company you were dreaming about. Congratulations!

You’ve worked so hard over the past year, learning new languages and building projects, so you truly deserve this success. I’m sure you’ll do great there and quickly become one of their top developers.

When do you start? Let me know your schedule and we can celebrate properly. Maybe we can go out for dinner this weekend or at least have a long video call if you’re too busy to meet in person.

I’m really proud of you, bro. Keep going and don’t forget your old friends when you become famous!

Warm wishes,
SABBIR

### Informal Letter 6 – Inviting a Cousin to Stay During Holidays

**Dear Shila,**

How are you? Our winter holidays are coming soon, and I was thinking it would be amazing if you could come and stay with us for a week.

We’re planning a few fun activities: a day trip to the nearby hill area, a barbecue on the rooftop and a movie night with all the cousins. Mum has already started talking about all the special dishes she’ll cook if you visit.

It has been almost a year since we last met, and I really miss our late-night chats and silly jokes. Please check your schedule and talk to your parents about it. I’ll convince my parents to call them too.

I hope you can make it. It would be the perfect way to end this year.

Best regards,
SABBIR

### Informal Letter 7 – Thanking a Friend for Hosting You

**Dear Ayan,**

Thanks again for letting me stay at your place last weekend. I had such a great time that I already miss your city.

Your parents were incredibly kind and made me feel completely at home. I still can’t stop thinking about your mother’s delicious biryani! I also loved the places you showed me, especially the riverside park and the old book market.

If you ever come to my city, my home is always open for you. I’ll try my best to give you the same warm welcome that you gave me.

Keep in touch and send my regards to your family.

Warm wishes,
SABBIR

### Informal Letter 8 – Sharing Exam Results with a Friend

**Dear Mehedi,**

I finally got my exam results today and I couldn’t wait to share the news with you.

I passed all my subjects and even scored an A in Mathematics and English. I was really worried about Physics, but thankfully I managed a decent grade there too. All those late-night study sessions were worth it!

How did your exams go? I know you were also stressed about yours. I hope you got the results you were aiming for. If not, don’t be upset. We can always work harder next time and support each other.

Let’s plan a small celebration this weekend. Maybe we can go for ice cream or just hang out at our usual spot.

Best regards,
SABBIR

### Informal Letter 9 – Advising a Friend About Time Management

**Dear Tuhin,**

I got your message about feeling stressed with your classes, job and personal projects. I completely understand how overwhelming it can be.

One thing that helped me was creating a simple weekly schedule. I divided my time into blocks for study, work and rest. I also started using a to-do list app and focused on finishing just three main tasks each day instead of trying to do everything at once.

Maybe you could try something similar. Don’t forget to give yourself some time to relax as well. A short walk or a quick chat with a friend can really refresh your mind.

If you want, we can sit together online this weekend and plan your schedule. I’d be happy to help.

Take care of yourself.

Warm wishes,
SABBIR

### Informal Letter 10 – Inviting a Friend to an Online Course Together

**Dear Zara,**

I hope things are going well with you. I recently found an interesting online course on web development and immediately thought of you.

The course covers HTML, CSS and basic JavaScript, and it’s designed for beginners. The lessons are short and there are plenty of practical exercises. I’ve already watched the first two modules and they’re very easy to follow.

Since you said you wanted to learn web design, why don’t we join it together? We could set a common study time each evening, complete the tasks and help each other if we get stuck. It would be fun and productive at the same time.

Let me know what you think. If you’re interested, I’ll send you the link.

Best regards,
SABBIR
