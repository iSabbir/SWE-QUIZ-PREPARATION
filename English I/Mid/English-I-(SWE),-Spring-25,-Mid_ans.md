3. Paragraph Writing (Choose one)
Option 1: Your Neighborhood

I live in a quiet and friendly neighborhood. The streets are clean and lined with trees that make the area look beautiful. There is a small park where children play every evening, and elderly people go for a walk. We have a community market nearby where we can buy fresh fruits and vegetables. My neighbors are kind and helpful, and everyone greets each other warmly. I feel safe and happy living in my neighborhood.

Option 2: A Frightening / Dangerous Experience

One night, I had a frightening experience while returning home during a storm. The streets were dark, and heavy rain made it difficult to see. Suddenly, a loud thunder crashed, and the lights went out. I felt scared and started walking faster. On my way, I slipped near a flooded area but managed to hold on to a fence. After a few minutes, I reached home safely. It was a night I will never forget.
