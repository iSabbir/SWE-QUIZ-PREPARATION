### **Descriptive Paragraph 1: My Favorite Tourist Spot**

My favorite tourist spot is Cox’s Bazar, the longest sea beach in the world, located in Bangladesh. The vast sandy shore, stretching over 120 kilometers, attracts visitors from all over the country. I love the rhythmic sound of the waves and the golden glow of the sunset reflecting on the water. The sea breeze feels refreshing and peaceful, helping me forget all stress. The nearby Burmese markets and seafood restaurants add extra charm to the place. Every visit gives me a new experience, and I always feel connected to nature there.

My house is a two-story building located in the quiet town of Nilphamari. It has a small garden in front, filled with colorful flowers and green plants that my mother takes care of. The walls are painted light cream, giving the house a warm and welcoming look. Inside, the rooms are well-arranged, with large windows allowing fresh air and sunlight to enter. My favorite place is my study room, where I keep my computer and books. My house is not just a place to live but a space filled with love, comfort, and memories.

### **Descriptive Paragraph 3: My Street**

The street where I live in Nilphamari is calm and clean. It is lined with trees on both sides, providing shade during the hot summer days. Children often play cricket in the afternoons, and elderly people take evening walks while chatting with neighbors. The local shops are small but full of daily necessities. At night, the streetlights make the area look bright and safe. What I love most about my street is the friendly atmosphere where everyone knows and helps each other.

### **Descriptive Paragraph 4: My Neighborhood**

My neighborhood is a friendly and peaceful place located near the center of Nilphamari town. Most of the people here know each other and share a strong sense of community. There is a small playground where children play football, and a mosque where everyone gathers for prayers. During festivals like Eid or Pohela Boishakh, the whole neighborhood becomes colorful and lively. People decorate their houses, exchange sweets, and celebrate together. I feel lucky to live in such a caring and cooperative community.

### **Descriptive Paragraph 5: My Town – Nilphamari**

Nilphamari is a small but beautiful town in the northern part of Bangladesh. It is known for its greenery, friendly people, and simple lifestyle. The town has several schools, markets, and parks that make life comfortable. The Nilphamari Railway Station connects us easily to other parts of the country. During winter, the fog-covered mornings make the town look magical. Despite being small, Nilphamari has everything one needs for a peaceful and happy life.

### **Narrative Paragraph 2: My Favourite Childhood Memory**

One of my favorite childhood memories is flying kites with my friends on the rooftop during winter afternoons in Nilphamari. The sky used to be full of colorful kites, and the excitement of cutting another kite was unforgettable. We laughed, shouted, and sometimes ran through the streets to catch falling kites. My mother used to call me for snacks, but I always wanted to stay longer. Those simple moments of joy and friendship remain deeply engraved in my heart, reminding me of the carefree days of my childhood.

### **Narrative Paragraph 3: A Frightening Experience**

One night during a heavy storm in Nilphamari, I had one of the most frightening experiences of my life. The electricity went out, and strong winds started shaking the trees around our house. Suddenly, a loud sound came from the backyard, and I thought something terrible had happened. My family and I gathered in one room, lighting candles and praying for safety. Later, we discovered that a large branch had fallen near our wall but luckily caused no damage. That night taught me how small and helpless we can feel in front of nature’s power, and I became more grateful for every safe and calm day.

### **Narrative Paragraph 4: A Memorable Journey**

Last year, I went on a memorable journey to Sylhet with my friends during our semester break. It was my first long trip without my family, and I was filled with excitement. We traveled by train, enjoying the beautiful green landscapes outside the window. In Sylhet, we visited Jaflong, Lalakhal, and Ratargul Swamp Forest. The clear blue water and the hills covered with clouds were breathtaking. We took many photos, sang songs on the bus, and shared stories at night. That journey gave me not only joy but also strong friendship bonds and unforgettable memories.

### **Narrative Paragraph 5: My Favourite Vacation**

My favorite vacation was when my family and I visited Rangamati during the summer holidays. It was my first time seeing so many hills and lakes together. We took a boat ride on Kaptai Lake, surrounded by green hills that looked like paintings. The peaceful water and gentle breeze made me feel relaxed. We also explored the tribal markets and tasted delicious local food. Every moment felt like a new adventure, far away from the busy life of town. That vacation remains one of the most beautiful experiences I have ever had.

### **Narrative Paragraph 6: An Unexpected Lesson I Learned Outside the Classroom**

One day, while returning home from Daffodil International University, I saw an old man struggling to cross the road. I quickly helped him, and he smiled, saying, “Kindness always comes back to you.” That small moment taught me a valuable lesson outside the classroom. We often think that learning happens only from books and teachers, but real education is also about being compassionate and responsible. Since then, I have tried to be more aware of the people around me and to help whenever I can. It was a simple yet powerful lesson that changed how I see life.
