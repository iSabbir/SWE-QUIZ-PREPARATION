**Slide 1 – Title**

Hello everyone,
Good morning to you all.

Today we are going to talk about the **Spiral Model** in software development.
This model was first proposed by **Barry Boehm**.

My name is **Debapriya**, and I will present the first part of this topic.
After my section, my teammate **Sabbir** will continue.

**Slide 2 – What is the Spiral Model?**

Now, let’s move to the next slide.

The Spiral Model is a **Software Development Life Cycle model**, or SDLC model.
It gives a **systematic and iterative** way to develop software.

In the diagram, you can see that the model looks like a **spiral with many loops**.
The **number of loops is not fixed**.
It can **change from project to project**, depending on the needs.

Each loop of the spiral represents **one phase** of the software development process.
So, when we move from one loop to the next, it means the project is going to the **next phase** with more details and improvements.

---

**Slide 3 – Phases of the Spiral Model**

In this slide, we can see the **main phases** of the Spiral Model.

1. **Objectives Defined**
   First, we decide the **objectives** of this phase.
   We understand what we want to achieve and what our options are.

2. **Risk Analysis and Resolving**
   Second, we **identify the risks**.
   We think about what can go wrong and how to **solve or reduce** those risks.

3. **Develop the Next Version of the Product**
   Third, we actually **develop or improve** the product.
   This may be a prototype or the next version with more features.

4. **Review and Plan for the Next Phase**
   Finally, we **review** the work done in this loop.
   Then we **plan** what to do in the next loop of the spiral.

**Slide 4 – Key Points**

Here are some important key points about the Spiral Model.

First, the **number of phases** or loops is **not fixed**.
The **project manager** can decide how many loops are needed, based on the **risks and complexity** of the project.

Second, because the project manager decides the phases, their **role is very important** in this model.
A good project manager can make the project successful by managing risks and planning properly.

Third, each loop of the spiral is like a **full mini software development cycle**.
In every loop, we go through **requirements, analysis, design, implementation, testing, and even maintenance planning**.
That means we are **constantly improving** the product in a controlled way.

With this, I will hand over to **Sabbir**, who will talk about the **advantages, disadvantages, and when we should use the Spiral Model.**

**Slide 5 – Advantages**

Thank you, Debapriya.

Hello everyone, I am **Sabbir**, and I will continue the presentation.

Now I will discuss the **advantages of the Spiral Model**.

1. **Risk Handling**
   The Spiral Model is very good at **handling risks**, because in every phase we do **risk analysis**.
   This helps us detect problems **early** and fix them.

2. **Good for Large Projects**
   It is very useful for **large and complex projects**.
   When a system is big, we need strong planning and risk management, which this model provides.

3. **Flexibility in Requirements**
   If the **requirements change later**, this model can handle it.
   We can adjust the plan in the next loop of the spiral and add or modify features.

4. **Customer Satisfaction**
   Customers can **see the product early** in the form of prototypes or early versions.
   Because they see progress regularly, their **satisfaction increases**.

5. **Iterative and Incremental Approach**
   The model is both **iterative and incremental**.
   That means we repeat cycles and **add features step by step**, instead of doing everything at once.

6. **Emphasis on Risk Management**
   Finally, it puts strong **focus on risk management**.
   This reduces uncertainty and makes the project more **reliable**.

**Slide 6 – Disadvantages**

Now, let’s look at the **disadvantages**.

1. **Complex**
   The Spiral Model is **more complex** than many other SDLC models.
   It is not very simple to understand and manage.

2. **Expensive**
   It is often **expensive**, so it is **not suitable for small projects**.

3. **Dependence on Risk Analysis**
   This model **depends heavily on risk analysis**.
   If the team does not have **experienced experts**, the risk analysis may be weak, and the project can fail.

4. **Difficulty in Time Management**
   The **number of phases is not fixed** at the beginning.
   Because of that, it is **hard to estimate the total time** needed.

5. **Time-Consuming**
   The model can be **time-consuming** because every loop needs **evaluation and review**.

6. **Resource Intensive**
   It needs a lot of **resources**, such as time, people, and money.
   Planning, risk analysis, and evaluation all take extra effort.

**Slide 7 – When to Use the Spiral Model**

Now I will explain **when we should use** the Spiral Model.

* When the software project is **large and complex**.
* When we need **frequent releases or updates**.
* When **prototyping** is needed to understand the system better.
* When **risk analysis and cost evaluation** are very important.
* When the project has **moderate to high risk**.
* When the **requirements are unclear or keep changing**.
* When **changes may happen at any stage** of development.
* And finally, when the project needs a **long-term commitment**.

In these situations, the Spiral Model can provide **better control and flexibility**.

We have now come to the end of our main discussion.

If you have **any questions** about the Spiral Model,
we will be happy to answer them.
