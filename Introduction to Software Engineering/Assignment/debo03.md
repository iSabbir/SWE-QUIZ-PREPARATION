| Semidetached  | 3.0 | 1.12 | 2.5 | 0.38 |
| Embedded      | 3.6 | 1.20 | 2.5 | 0.12 |

A **Hospital Patient Management System** is considered a **semidetached** project with an expected size of **75 KLOC**. Using the coefficients in the table above and the **BASIC COCOMO MODEL**, calculate the **recommended number of people** required to complete the project.
