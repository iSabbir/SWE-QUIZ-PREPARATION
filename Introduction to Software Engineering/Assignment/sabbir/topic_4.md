# Topic 04: Intermediate COCOMO - Real-Time Traffic Monitoring System

Use the information given in the table below:

| Project Class | aᵦ | bᵦ  | cᵦ | dᵦ  |
| ------------- | --- | ---- | --- | ---- |
| Organic       | 2.4 | 1.05 | 2.5 | 0.38 |
| Semidetached  | 3.0 | 1.12 | 2.5 | 0.38 |
| Embedded      | 3.6 | 1.20 | 2.5 | 0.12 |

A **Real-Time Traffic Monitoring and Control System** for a smart city consists of three modules:

- Sensor data collection & preprocessing: **8.0 KLOC**
- Real-time traffic analysis & decision engine: **11.5 KLOC**
- Control dashboard & reporting module: **5.0 KLOC**

The project is classified as an **Embedded** software project.

The following **cost drivers** and **Effort Adjustment Factors (EAF)** are given:

| Cost Driver                  | Level     | Effort Adjustment Factor |
| ---------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------ |
| Product complexity           | Very High | 1.30                     |
| Required reliability         | High      | 1.15                     |
| Required storage             | High      | 1.06                     |
| Execution time constraints   | High      | 1.10                     |
| Analyst capability           | Low       | 1.23                     |

Using the **Intermediate COCOMO Model**, calculate the **recommended average team size (number of people)** needed for the project.
