# Topic 02: Intermediate COCOMO - Hospital Information System

Use the information given in the table below:

| Project Class | aᵦ | bᵦ  | cᵦ | dᵦ  |
| ------------- | --- | ---- | --- | ---- |
| Organic       | 2.4 | 1.05 | 2.5 | 0.38 |
| Semidetached  | 3.0 | 1.12 | 2.5 | 0.38 |
| Embedded      | 3.6 | 1.20 | 2.5 | 0.12 |

A **Hospital Information System** consists of three modules:

- Patient registration & appointment management: **6.0 KLOC**
- Electronic medical records (EMR): **9.5 KLOC**
- Billing & insurance claim processing: **4.0 KLOC**

The project is classified as a **Semidetached** software project.

The following **cost drivers** and **Effort Adjustment Factors (EAF)** are given:

| Cost Driver           | Level   | Effort Adjustment Factor |
| --------------------- | ------- | ------------------------ |
| Product complexity    | High    | 1.18                     |
| Required storage      | High    | 1.06                     |
| Time constraint       | High    | 1.08                     |
| Programmer capability | Low     | 1.17                     |
| Use of modern tools   | Nominal | 1.00                     |

Using the **Intermediate COCOMO Model**, calculate the **recommended average team size (number of people)** needed for the project.
