# Topic 01: Lines of Code (LOC) - Hospital Patient Management System

A Hospital Patient Management System is being developed for a medium-sized hospital. The software will handle patient registration, doctor appointments, medical records, billing, and prescription tracking. Before creating an appointment, the system checks doctor availability, patient’s previous medical history and required department/doctor specialization. After appointment confirmation, the system generates patient visit tokens, stores prescriptions in patient history.
